about: "I've been playing Duel Links since April of last year, introduced to it by a pleb named Andlu. 
Prior to that, I only ever played the TCG casually with friends back in middle school, so I was familiar with the game rules and many cards. Got used to the game quickly. 
I'd say the main reason I stuck with this game, despite it being so fucking expensive to keep up with, is because of the DLM community and the friends I've made here. 

A brief Irl intro: I'm 22 years old, Canadian, and currently attending University. I'm a chill dude so feel free to ask me any Duel Links related questions via Discord. 
I've got a vast amount of knowledge cuz I have no life playing this children's card game. "
