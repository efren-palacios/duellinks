### HOW TO SPEND GEMS
					
First and foremost what you have to recognise is that every gem you invest is and should be a
strategic decision that will influence how well you do in future duels.

Being able to correctly invest is what distinguishes good and bad f2p players (and people who only
invest limited amounts of money)

In this guide I will give you an idea which cards are worth buying and why.

Generally when deciding wether or not a pack is worth investing in you only have to look at the SR
and UR cards. Getting multiple copies of a Rare or Common card usually only requires a little
amount of gems in comparison.

The first question you should ask yourself before investing is always:
Do I already have a deck that is able to hit the King of Games (KoG) rank?

If the answer is yes then DO NOT INVEST your gems. Save them until an important competitive
event that you want to participate in happens (like a KC-Cup or a Meta Championship Series).

This way you will be able to play the best possible deck for that event.

However if the answer is no then you want to invest your gems until you can play one of these
decks (or a similar list):

### **Tier 1: Cyber Angels**

### **Tier 2: Ninjas, Red-Eyes-Zombies**

### Investing = SR / UR cards
Now im gonna go about each box in depth: (I will only focus on **SR and UR cards**. Some boxes
might have Rare and Common cards worth getting)

### **Boxes to NOT Invest in:**

#### **-Echos of Silence**
{% include twoimages.html image1="https://i.imgur.com/cfEwFxq.png"%}

#### **-Land of the Titans**
{% include twoimages.html image1="https://i.imgur.com/04LoO5I.png"%}

#### **-Chaotic Compliance**(this box has some good Rares and Commons)
{% include twoimages.html image1="https://i.imgur.com/6RlsAUR.png"%}

#### **-Wonders of the Sky**
{% include twoimages.html image1="https://i.imgur.com/k1URcW4.png"%}

#### **-Age of Discovery**
{% include twoimages.html image1="https://i.imgur.com/1I3waAW.png"%}

#### **-Sorcerer's Alliance**
{% include twoimages.html image1="https://i.imgur.com/UFxqgvT.png"%}

#### **-Dragonic Force**
{% include twoimages.html image1="https://i.imgur.com/XFZV7Hf.png"%}

#### **-Hero Rising**
{% include twoimages.html image1="https://i.imgur.com/0WF7ClD.png"%}

#### **-Legendary Warriors**
{% include twoimages.html image1="https://i.imgur.com/B6cLxOL.png"%}

None of theses boxes have **UR** or **SR** that are played in the competitive decks listed above. 

**The most important thing to know about a box is when to reset it:**

-In large boxes you only have to look at the **UR cards**, since you will get the SR card 6x by going
through the box 3 times anyway.

-In small boxes you have to take the **SR** into consideration aswell.
