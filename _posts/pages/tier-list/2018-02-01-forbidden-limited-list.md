#### FORBIDDEN
When cards are assigned as this, you may not include any of these into your deck.

#### Limited 
When cards are assigned as this, you may include only one card into your deck out of all the limited cards. Example: Since [Woodland Sprite] and [Golden Bamboo Sword] are limited, you can only include one or the other in your deck, not one of each.

[deck](Champion's Vigilance; Golden Bamboo Sword; Restructer Revolution; Woodland Sprite)

#### SEMI-LIMITED
When cards are assigned as this, you may include only up to two cards into your deck out of all the semi-limited cards. Example: Since [Machine Angel Ritual] (A) and Cyber Angel Dakini (B) are semi-limited, you can have one of the following combinations of these cards in your deck [(A/B), (A/A) or (B/B)]. You are not allowed to have two copies of each card in your deck.

[deck](Cyber Angel Dakini; Machine Angel Ritual; Red-Eyes Spirit)
