## General Overview of Player and Deck
					
Hi, my name is Kazin_X, I just reached my 10th season KoG with 3SD Ninja. Each season I try to do something innovative and different from the meta. I feel the ranked climb is a good opportunity to test new decks and change up the meta. Last season, I shook it up a bit by being one of the first players to reach KoG and showcase ninja’s power by playing “**Beatdown Ninja**”. However, this season the deck felt ridiculously underwhelming and couldn’t really hang with bigger and faster deck. I am not sure what changed, because “**Echoes of Silence**” didn’t bring with it any amazing cards to support existing archetype. But something has changed, whether it be community awareness, new meta trending decks, or a combination of both, ninja power was greatly reduced.

So to combat this, I decided to switch up the skill choice and go with **3 Star Demotion**. This skill allows you to get out **the bigger, stronger, and more versatile ninjas**, such as “Black Dragon Ninja” and “Red Dragon Ninja” easier. These powerhouse cards not only served as the main attackers of the deck, but **also the main launch pad**, allowing you to jump from one ninja to another or one ninja to two/three through the “Ninjitsu Art” trap cards. Collaborating with members of “Duel Links Meta” discord, the final approved version and the version that I believe is most optimized is posted below.

On my way to KoG, I went 10-2, with a flawless 8-0. Including the two lost, the best record was 15-2. This deck was a lot of fun to play, probably one of the most dynamic and interactive deck you will play in Duel Links right now. This deck requires the user to know their options (there is so many!) and also play focused. One can easily misplay this deck and then consider it a terrible deck.

Below I will show you all the cards, combos, plays, tricks, and match-ups to help you better understand Ninjas and how effective it can truly be. To be honest, even though I reached KoG with this deck, I think there is still room to evolve and learn about this archetype. **There is so much power, versatility, and flexibility with this archetype that it is still fun to play with 2 seasons later.**

I hope you guys enjoy the breakdown below!

### Closing Statement 

I want to first thank all the readers whom have made it this far into the guide/breakdown. I wanted to explain in detail the power of the ninja deck, because it can easily be misunderstood due to the complex options it provides.
No other deck is like the ninja right now. In my conversation with fellow discord member, itsyoboyeden, we hit on a unique description of 3SD ninjas: 
To play Ninja at its best, YOU need to be at 100%, because the ninja deck is so sideway and unique, covering a multitude of decks. Depending on the match-up, you can slow-roll, burst, or a mix of both. Most decks do not have that many gears, that many options. A lot of players cannot handle all the options.
I am still learning about the ninja deck…that’s the crazy part. There is endless number of combos and out. You need to understand what options you have, to play it correctly. AND as more cards get released, whether it be ninja cards or certain winged-beast/beast/insect cards, the more complex ninjas can be.
This is one of the top decks that is growing as the pool of cards is growing. A lot of decks die by the way-side as more cards get released. This is not one of them. They are still one of the most entertaining, powerful, and interesting archetype after 2 seasons. I hope it will stay that way for many seasons to come.
