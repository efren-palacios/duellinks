### Event Strategy

[deck:Restart](King of the Swamp; King of the Swamp; King of the Swamp; Buster Blader; Buster Blader; Buster Blader; Goddess with the Third Eye; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Dark Magician;  Dark Magician; Dark Magician; Union Attack; Union Attack; Polymerization; Polymerization; Polymerization; Emblem of Dragon Destroyer; Pot of Benevolence; Pot of Benevolence; Secret Pass to the Treasures)

Fuse Dark Paladin as soon as possible and use his effect to negate {Lightning Vortex} and {Level Up!} and you just continue to deck out using {King of the Swamp} to thin your deck and {Pot of Benevolence} for the 8000 DA score.

**There is a chance that Chazz will clog your field with {Give and Take} so it is wise to save a tribute summon just to play around this**

[deck:Restart](The Winged Dragon of Ra; Golden Ladybug;  Golden Ladybug; Golden Ladybug; Cosmic Compass; Creature Seizure; Double Summon; Defense Draw; Defense Draw; Wall of Disruption; Wall of Disruption; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Curse of Anubis; Windstorm of Etaqua; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Aegis of Gaia)

Strategy:
You can use any skill. Stall until the final turn. Try to reach 10k LP before then. You get 1200 DA pts for summoning Ra. 
On the final turn:
1) Normal Summon Cosmic Compass. Summon two Tokens in Attack Position from its effect.
2) Activate Creature Seizure. Exchange one of your Tokens for one of Chazz' monsters.
3) Activate Double Summon.
4) Tribute Summon The Winged Dragon of Ra.
5) Enter the Battle Phase and attack the Token with Ra to end the Duel.

Alternatives:
Jar of Greed, Nutrient Z, Draining Shield, Kiseitai (I actually replaced Aegis of Gaia and 1x Golden Ladybug for two of these), Winged Kuriboh, Enchanted Javelin, Supremacy Berry
