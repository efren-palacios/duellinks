### Event Strategy

[Deck: Restart](King of the Swamp; King of the Swamp; King of the Swamp; Buster Blader; Buster Blader; Buster Blader; Buster Blader; Goddess with the Third Eye; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Dark Magician;  Dark Magician; Dark Magician; Union Attack; Union Attack; Polymerization; Polymerization; Polymerization; Emblem of Dragon Destroyer; Pot of Benevolence; Pot of Benevolence; Secret Pass to the Treasures)

Fuse Dark Paladin as soon as possible and use his effect to negate {Lightning Vortex} and {Level Up} and you just continue to deck out using {King of the Swamp} to thin your deck and {Pot of Benevolence} for the 8000 DA score.

**There is a chance that Chazz will clog your field with {Give and Take} so it is wise to save a tribute summon just to play around this**
