***Level 40 Farm - created by JadeHex***  
**7,100 Base DA (Duel Assessment)**

[deck](Summoner of Illusions; Magnetic Mosquito; Magnetic Mosquito; Magnetic Mosquito; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Medusa Worm; Medusa Worm; Medusa Worm; Anti-Magic Arrows; Union Attack; Union Attack; Array of Revealing Light; Array of Revealing Light; Array of Revealing Light; Acid Rain; Acid Rain; Pot of Benevolence; A Feint Plan; A Feint Plan; A Feint Plan; Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon; Master of Oz)

**Strategy**
- Stall until you can use {Array of Revealing Light} and select 'Machine'
- Keep using {Medusa Worm} to destroy his monsters every turn
- Stall by using {Magnetic Mosquito} and {A Feint Plan}

**Endgame** 
- On the *second to last turn* set {Summoner of Illusions}
- On the *last turn*, flip up {Medusa Worm} if he has a monster
- Flip up {Summoner of Illusions} and tribute {Medusa Worm} to summon {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon} or {Master of Oz}
- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Double {Union Attack} onto {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} and swing for game


**Replacements**
- Any consistency improving skill such as Restart or Duel Standby can be used
- {Medusa Worm} or {Magnetic Mosquito} can be switched with {Guardian Statue}
- You *must* have {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon} or {Master of Oz}
- {Summoner of Illusions} endgame can be replaced with {Mystical Beast of Serket} and {Temple of the Kings}
- {A Feint Plan} can be replaced with {Windstorm of Etaqua} or {Curse of Anubis}

**Risks**
- This farm deck is hugely reliant on its combo pieces. Not getting {Medua Worm} or {Array of Revealing Light} in time is deadly

***Level 40 Farm - created by Freeska***  
**7,400 Base DA (Duel Assessment)**

[deck: Destiny Draw](Catapult Turtle; Black Ptera; Black Ptera; Black Ptera; Soul Exchange; Jam Breeding Machine; Jam Breeding Machine; Jam Breeding Machine; The Regulation of Tribe; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; De-Spell; Windstorm of Etaqua)

**Strategy**
- Use Destiny Draw to grab {The Regulation of Tribe} and select 'Machine'
- Activate {Jam Breeding Machine} allowing you to pay the cost of {The Regulation of Tribe} every turn. {Black Ptera} can stall until you get this

**Endgame** 
- Before the *last turn*, use {Massivemorph} 3 times on his highest attack monster (usually {Ancient Gear Golem})
- On the *second to last turn*, {De-Spell} your {Jam Breeding Machine} and summon a {Black Ptera} such that you have at least 2 monsters on the field
- On the *last turn*, tribute summon {Catapult Turtle}
- Activate {Soul Exchange} and select the monster you used {Massivemorph} on
- Activate {Catapult Turtle} to tribute his own monster and inflict over 10,000 damage to him


**Replacements**
- Destiny Draw is irreplaceable 
- {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced with {Legacy of Yata-Garasu}
- {Catapult Turtle} endgame can be replaced with two copies of {Enemy Controller} to take his {Massivemorph}ed monster, switch another monster to attack postion, and swing for game. Don't forget {Anti-Magic Arrows}

**Risks**
- You can potentially lose before getting to use your Destiny Draw, which is why we use  {Windstorm of Etaqua} 
- Crowler will occasionally use {Spell Gear} and wipe a monster you used {Massivemorph} on away. Usually this isn't detrimental, but it can affect DA

**Strategy**
- Use {Magical Mallet} and {Crystal Seer} to get a copy of both {Spirit Barrier} and {Astral Barrier}, rendering all of Crowler's attacks useless
