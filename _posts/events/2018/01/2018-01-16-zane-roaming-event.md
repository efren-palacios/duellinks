### Event Strategy (Last Updated: 09/01/2018)
#### Cloudian Zane Farm By: Freeskadoodle
How To Play: 
Use 'Draw Sense - Water to fish out our Cloudian - Turbulence which can't be destroyed by battle. 
Spirit Barrier OR Sanctuary in the Sky protect our life points. 
Final turn combo is to summon Vassal, summon Caligo Crow, use Double Magical Arm Bind to tribute Caligo and Cloudian and take his two biggest monsters. 
Then the Union combo. 

Replacements:
Arm bind can be replaced by two econs.

Disclaimer:  You will lose if he summons Lightray Daedalus by banishing 4 light monsters and you or him have a field spell out.  Also you wont get 9999 damage if you draw {Double Magical Arm Bind} last.

#### Unhappy Girl Ra Balance Zane Farm By: Pelat
How To Play: UG + Barrier, attack his monster, FTH his Daedalus, gain LP with Ladybug, summon Ra last turn (it will be over 13000 minimun if you played correctly).  Always remember to not clock up your monster zone due to the fact that rai-mei could search both UG and Ladybug (usually summon the third UG once you have 3 ladybug in hand).  Cloudian doesn't lock opponent but it's a #4/5 UG for consistency.
