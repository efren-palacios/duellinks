New files for **upcoming events and cards** have been found in game!  
The drop list for Dr Vellian Crowler of the upcoming 'Dr Crowler's Tricky Tests' event has been datamined. The event is expected mid to late February.

Files for what appear to be the new cards from the upcoming *Dr. Crowler's Tricky Tests* event have been discovered!

**New** obtainable drop rewards found:

[deck](Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem; Biofalcon; Break! Draw!)

*note: the grey card is {Biofalcon}*

In addition, players will possibly be able to obtain **up to 3 copies** of {Ancient Gear Castle} and {Ancient Gear Golem}, previously only obtainable as level up rewards.

*Keep in mind that much of the datamined information is speculation, and remains unconfirmed until officially announced by Konami.*

### TPC on the New Cards

**[Superforms](/authors/superforms/)** says: 
{Biofalcon} is garbage. Cards that activate on battle destruction aren't even good now, and this is one step worse.

{Break! Draw!} seems bad as well because it's a card that would replace a protection card in the current builds, and that's not something a control deck like Ancient Gears usually wants to lose. 

{Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem} could be used with {King of the Swamp} and {Cybernetic Fusion Support}, but Ancient Gears doesn't have any good searching power, and so you'd really just have to wait to draw into the materials. You could also run a Last Gamble build, possibly with {Spell Gear} but you would lose the {Ancient Gear Castle} provided by Middle Age Mechs.


### Meta Impact

The return of this event has some potentially important factors in the current meta which has a lot of players excited:

 - New players will have access to Ancient Gear cards, which are the core of a current Tier 3 deck
 - 3 copies of {Ancient Gear Golem} will potentially be available
 - 3 copies of {Ancient Gear Castle} will potentially be available

**[Superforms](/authors/superforms/)** says: 
A third {Ancient Gear Golem} is interesting, especially now that we get more {Ancient Gear Castle}s too. Of everything coming in this new event, I think triple {Ancient Gear Golem} builds have the most potential to be good.
Overall I'd say Ancient Gears are still a solid Tier 3 deck.

**[Nix](/authors/nix/)** says:
Ancient Gears will rise after this KC Cup, take my word for it.

**Brenduke**, an Ancient Gear player who has reached Top 4 and Top 16 in 2 Meta Weeklies, says:
A third {Ancient Gear Golem} opens up potential for more aggressive builds. The build could also run {Ancient Gear Beast} with {Soul Exchange} and {Fenghuang} support if {Ancient Gear Castle} is added. A third {Ancient Gear Golem} also makes {Spell Gear} (Crowler's Level 40 reward) potentially good but most likely remains a YouTube play.
The most important part of the new Crowler event is obviously prismatic {Ancient Gear Golem} though.

### Summary

This datamine should leave new and old players excited alike. New players will get access to one of the most flexible and beginner-friendly decks, while old players can look forward to upgrading their Ancient Gears with new playstyles not available before. The new drop rewards are lacking, but {Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem} shows some promise.
