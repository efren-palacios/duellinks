Files for what appear to be the new cards from the upcoming *Dr. Crowler's Tricky Tests* event have been discovered!

**New** obtainable drop rewards found:

[deck](Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem; Biofalcon; Break! Draw!)

*note: the grey card is {Biofalcon}*

In addition, players will be able to obtain **up to 3 copies** of {Ancient Gear Castle} and {Ancient Gear Golem}, previously only obtainable as level up rewards

*Keep in mind that much of the datamined information is speculation, and remains unconfirmed until officially announced by Konami.*
