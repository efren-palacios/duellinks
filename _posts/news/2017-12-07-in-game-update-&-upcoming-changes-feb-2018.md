### Updates
As of the recent in-game news update, 2018 is already full of changes and updates. I'm going to break it down to give the community a snapshot of what they need to know.

#### Skill Rebalancing
* On January 24th Konami implemented a long list of skill rebalancing changes in order to keep the ranked PVP as balanced as possible. The most notable changes were to {Three-Star Demotion}, {Destiny Draw}, and Bastian Misawa's elemental skills such as {Firm as EARTH}.

#### Forbidden/Limited List
In addition to the skill rebalance, additional cards were added to the limited list in response to the outcry of players being OTK'd.
1. Implemented on January 24th, Woodland Sprite was limited to one.
