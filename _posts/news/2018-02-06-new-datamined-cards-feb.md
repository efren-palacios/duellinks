Finally, some **new cards** were found in the latest leak as well

[deck](Master Gig; D.D. Telepon; Psychic Overload)

These new psychic support cards seem to be the **new drops** from the upcoming Espa Roba event. A full list of all drops, as well as a guide on how to farm Espa Roba, will be released once the event begins.

[deck](Aromage Jasmine; Aromage Rosemary; Miracle Fertilizer; Aroma Garden)

These new plant support cards may be future additions to the **card trader**, to accompany {Aromage Bergamot}.

Finally, text for the 3D summon animation for everyone's favorite **Egyptian God Card**, {Obelisk the Tormentor}, was also found in the updated files!

*Keep in mind that much of the datamined information is speculation, and remains unconfirmed until officially announced by Konami.*
