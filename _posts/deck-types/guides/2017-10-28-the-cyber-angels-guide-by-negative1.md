### Overview

#### Introduction

Cyber Angels is a deck that has undergone many changes since its admission to Duel Links. While previously an OTK deck, CA has evolved to a fast deck that can OTK but is best suited for controlling the board and overwhelming opponents through resource management. This guide will briefly discuss common plays, but the goal of this guide is to make you recognize possible options that are being neglected.

### Adressing Nerfs

#### How Have the Nerfs Affected CA?

The nerfs to {Cyber Angel Dakini}, {Machine Angel Ritual}, and {Balance} are serious concerns, however I understand the necessity to do so. What was once a tier 0 deck is not tier 0 anymore, but CA without a doubt is a strong deck. The reason CA performed so poorly prior to Meta Championship Series (MCS) 5 can be attributed to {Enemy Controller} and {Floodgate Trap Hole} remaining in the meta. However, as CA representation diminished, these cards were swapped out for more effective options against Red-Eyes Zombies, Hazy Flame and Gladiator Beasts decks. Much like how Dkayed placed first the November KC Cup with Ninjas, CA won the MCS through a mixture of surprise factor and taking advantage of the meta.

### The Decklist Breakdown

#### Skills To Run With Cyber Angels

#### Balance

{Balance} is the most consistent of the skills CA has to offer. You are guaranteed to have at least 1 ritual spell, meaning you have plays 99% of the time. The downside to Balance is that you can’t run spell techs as you are more susceptible to bricking. If you plan on playing spells tech cards, you are better off running a different skill. Balance is one of the best skills for every CA matchup except the mirror.

#### Restart

{Restart} is the most versatile of CA’s skills. CA already has a somewhat low chance of bricking, but with restart you can lower it even farther. Restart helps you open with tech cards or cards that you believe will help you the most in any given matchup. However, the issue with Restart is that there is no guarantee, only a second chance. Restart is the best skill for the mirror and is not restricted from using spells in the same way Balance is.

#### The Core Cards

###### **Cards Necessary in Every Competitive Cyber Angels Deck**

##### Ritual Monsters

[deck](Saffira, Queen of Dragons; Cyber Angel Dakini; Cyber Angel Idaten; Cyber Angel Benten)

##### Saffira, Queen of Dragons
AKA Saffira  
Role: Boss Monster, Resource Control

[deck](Saffira, Queen of Dragons)

With {Cyber Angel Dakini} and {Machine Angel Ritual} semi-limited, CA needs a substitute to adequately wall out opponents while generating advantage. Saffira brings a large amount of depth to CA and even more so the mirror. While the gameplan with Dakini was to overwhelm with effects and removal, the gameplan with Saffira is to control material while establishing and maintaining a winning position. More about Saffira’s effect in combos and plays: [Using Saffira’s effect](#using-saffira’s-effect)

**Recommended 3**

---

##### Cyber Angel Dakini
AKA Dakini  
Role: Boss Monster, Resource Control, OTK weapon

[deck](Cyber Angel Dakini)

Dakini is the signature monster of this deck, but it is also **the source of many misplays by CA players**. Knowing when and how to use Dakini is one of the most important skills a CA player needs to find success. NOTE: Main decking 1 Dakini is recommended, but having a second Dakini in your side deck can be useful for matchups where the removal effect is more valuable than the protection MAR offers.

**Recommended 1**

---

##### Cyber Angel Idaten
AKA Idaten  
Role: Combo Starter, Stall

[deck](Cyber Angel Idaten)

Idaten is used in the most common CA combo, tribute Benten to summon Idaten. This will be discussed further in combos. Tributing Idaten also allows you to boost all of your ritual monsters by 1000 attack which will help you run through an opponent’s MW or WoD.

**Run 1**

---

##### Cyber Angel Benten
AKA Benten  
Role: Combo Starter, Combo Extender, Deck Thinning

[deck](Cyber Angel Benten)

Benten is primarily tribute fodder. Summoning her is a bad move in most cases because you don’t get an additional effect when summoned as opposed to Dakini and Idaten. Summoning her is is best reserved for slower decks and dire situations where you need to boost your boss monsters.

**Recommended 3**

---

##### Searchers

[deck](Senju of the Thousand Hands; Cyber Petit Angel)

##### Senju of the Thousand Hands
AKA Senju  
Role: Search Ritual Monsters

[deck](Senju of the Thousand Hands)

Senju searches out ritual monsters and can be searched out by the ritual monsters.

**Run 2-3** depending on skill used

---

##### Cyber Petit Angel
AKA Petit  
Role: Search MAR, Search Ritual Monsters

[deck](Cyber Petit Angel)

Petit is the best searcher in this deck. If you are in need of a combo piece, Petit can search it. The only down sides to petit are low stats and the inability to search Saffira.

**Run 2**

---

##### Ritual Spells

[deck](Machine Angel Absolute Ritual; Hymn of Light; Machine Angel Ritual; Sprite's Blessing)

##### Machine Angel Absolute Ritual
AKA MAAR  
Role: Summon your Ritual Monsters, Restock your Deck

[deck](Machine Angel Absolute Ritual)

This card can only be searched by {Sonic Bird} and Idaten, and it can’t be returned to the hand. However, MAAR is still an amazing card in its own right, and you want as many ritual spells as you can get with MAR semi-limited to 1.

**Recommended 1-2**

---

##### Hymn of Light
AKA Hymn  
Role: Summon Saffira, Protection

[deck](Hymn of Light)

While Hymn is limited to only summoning Saffira, it provides protection while in the Graveyard as it can banish itself to prevent a ritual monster(s) from being destroyed.

**Run 2-3**

---

##### Machine Angel Ritual
AKA MAR  
Role: Summon your Ritual Monsters, Protection

[deck](Machine Angel Ritual)

Konami hit this card hard with the new banlist, and not without a good reason. MAR is overall better than MAAR. It’s easier to get to your hand from the deck or Graveyard, and does not require an exact level to use. It also protects your LIGHT monsters while in the graveyard, resulting in cards such as Divine Wrath and Super Rush Headlong becoming weak choices against CA.

**Recommended 1**

---

##### Sprite's Blessing
AKA Sprite  
Role: Subsitute Ritual Spell

[deck](Sprite's Blessing)

With MAR semi limited, Sprite can be used as a replacement ritual spell. You do not get the protection of MAR or Hymn, or the Graveyard synergy of MAAR, but you can use it to summon any LIGHT Ritual monster.

**Recommended 1-3**

---

#### Notably Ommited Cards

###### **Cards That Have Been Improperly Deemed Core**

##### Vennu, Bright Bird of Divinity
AKA Vennu  
Role: Boss Monster, Resource Control

[deck](Vennu, Bright Bird of Divinity)

Vennu is a boss monster that sees use as a substitute for Saffira. Vennu has the benefit of being a Fairy and is therefore searchable by Benten, however Vennu is a win more variant of CA that lacks defense. With 2000 defense, vennu can die to a boosted laquari or AG Knight. Vennu is also level 8, meaning you can’t summon her with a single Benten, you instead must summon her like a Dakini. The unfortunate reality is that Vennu does not generate advantage like Dakini and as a result is less useful.

**Run 0-2**, but only if you don't have Saffira.

---

##### Sonic Bird
AKA Bird  
Role: Search Ritual Spells

Since the birth of CA, Sonic Bird has always struggled to find its place among the other searchers. Myself and a number of other CA players agree that **Sonic Bird is no longer a core card in the Cyber Angels lineup**. This is not to dismiss the possibility that Sonic Bird may later increase in value or even see play, but rather that CA has a number of alternatives that render Sonic Bird a tech rather than a necessity.

**Run 0-2** depending on skill used

---

#### **Techs and Replacements**

Tech cards are an important part of every deck. However, it is important to know that some tech cards synergize with a deck more than others. Please remember that “**what is or is not good**” is intended as “**what is or is not good for CA**".

---
#### What is Currently Good  

##### Enemy Controller

[deck](Enemy Controller)

Econ has historically been the poster child of countering CA. With little to no backrow, CA is susceptible to econ take plays as well as losing Dakini if she uses her effect. While I believe Floodgate is presently the most effective card against CA, econ is still the strongest tech in the mirror match.

**Tech / Can replace:** 

[deck](Senju of the Thousand Hands; Cyber Petit Angel)

---

##### Strong Defensive Traps

[deck](Curse of Anubis; Wall of Disruption; Mirror Wall; Windstorm of Etaqua)

These traps vary in use. Curse is arguably the most versatile of the four, but Wall of Disruption is the best in the mirror. These cards will help you stall until you can get more combo pieces, but I recommend a soft limit of 1 because stall cards don’t really work towards CA’s win condition.  


**Tech**

---

##### “Anti Backrow” or “Backrow Hate"

[deck](Cosmic Cyclone; Fire Formation - Gyokkou; Double Cyclone; Greenkappa; Fenghuang; Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress; Xing Zhen Hu; Anti-Magic Arrows)

The catalog of cards CA has available to deal with backrow has increased significantly since the last time I’ve updated this guide. The best options available are the first three. There are a number of other cards that have seen use, but will most likely be relegated to the side deck.

**Tech**

---

#### What Might Be Good But Is Underutilized

##### Bacon Saver

[deck](Bacon Saver)

While previously seen as a REZ only card, Bacon Saver is also a good tech card for CA because of its level and graveyard effect. Bacon can be used to win the mirror going first; summoning a searcher turn 1 without protection is almost a guaranteed loss in the mirror, but setting bacon turn 1 and passing is far safer and a great defense against Dakini pushes.

**Tech**

---

##### Floodgate Trap Hole

[deck](Floodgate Trap Hole)

Floodgate is an overall good card, but lacks synergy with CA. Setting problematic monsters face down is best reserved for monsters with strong effects, not just monsters with strong attack. However, eliminating monster based threats is not a task CA struggles with, and floodgate is not an effective counter to the current tier 1. While they may not be common in the most relevant decks, you can activate Floodgate in response to your opponent summoning Lava Golem, as well as in response to a Gemini Summon.

**Tech**

---
##### Forbidden Chalice

Chalice has not seen much use, but I believe that it may become a tech to handle the mirror and to stop GB tags. It may also be useful against REZ to prevent milling, but negating a searcher’s effect or a tagout can win you games as it slows down their deck and can swing the momentum into your favor.

**Tech**

---

#### What May Be Good Later

##### Skelengel

[deck](Skelengel)

Skelengel is a Free to Play substitute for other searchers but has no real place in an optimal build for CA. For a while it was considered for CA, and even found use in Bamboo CA, but spending a Normal Summon on Skelengel is a dangerous game. You only want to see Skelengel early and it doesn’t allow you to choose what you get from the deck.

**Can replace:** 

[deck](Cyber Petit Angel; Senju of the Thousand Hands)

---

##### Sergeant Electro

[deck](Sergeant Electro)

Electro struggles to find a place in CA. Electro is a relatively weak monster that can only lock down 1 card at a time; using electro will result in multiple instances where you attempt to lock down a backrow just to have him get outed on the next turn. CA cannot afford to waste card space or Normal Summons on electro and have no consistent way to protect him. Running Electro in CA requires you to rework most of your deck to accommodate for the slower style, and will likely result in a harder time in the mirror.

**Tech**

---

##### Sphere Kuriboh

[deck](Sphere Kuriboh)

SK used to be a semi-common tech in CA, but as time has passed people have realized that SK is not very effective. This is mostly because econ does SK’s job and is far more versatile. Running 1 is fine, but running 2 may be a tad much. Don’t run 2 SK just because of its secondary effect. Relinquished was able to run SK because they are both level 1 and it was a free summon at no cost. CA can run SK, but all of the core monsters in CA are of even level, so using SK second effect of banishing from the grave won’t get used unless you are able to get both SK into play (your hand or graveyard).

**Tech / Can replace:** 

[deck](Cyber Petit Angel; Senju of the Thousand Hands)

##### “Spell Counters”

[deck](Spell Shield Type-8; Magic Drain; Magic Deflector; Riryoku Field)

These cards saw some play at the start of the CA meta, but have died down in popularity as they are not as versatile or consistent as other options.

**Tech**

#### What Is Not Good

##### Super Rush Headlong

[deck](Super Rush Headlong)

Super Rush had it’s use in the previous meta, but the monster removal Dakini provides is far better, not to mention econ has more utility. This card is terrible in the CA mirror because your opponent can banish a MAR or Hymn and the result is usually crashing into an opponent’s boss monster.


##### Divine Wrath

[deck](Divine Wrath)

Divine Wrath and similar effect negation cards can negate effects, but this effect is not as relevant in the current meta. If you chain dwrath when an opponent summons a Dakini, their Dakini will be safe as long as they tributed a Benten or an Idaten for the summon. This is because of a ruling in Yugioh called “SEGOC” or “Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain.” Since Dakini’s effect and Benten’s / Idaten’s effect would all be activated simultaneously, they go on chain; dwrath can only negate the last link in the chain, so Dakini gets protected. Chalice is overall a faster and less costly option, not to mention it is chainable.

#####  Sky Scourge Enrise

[deck](Sky Scourge Enrise)

With the excess of LIGHT fairy type monsters in CA, some people have tried running Enrise along with SK, or at the very least have attempted to do so. The problem is that Enrise is far too slow for the current meta. Enrise requires multiple turns of set up to even summon, turns that the opponent can use to draw into their answers.

---

### Combos and Plays

   The nerfs have hit some combos harder than others, but most are still possible. The nerfs have limited the use of combos to only allow for 1 Dakini and 1 MAR or 2 Dakini and 0 MAR, and combos that rely on MAR being in the hand or in the Graveyard are far less applicable.

#### Idaten + Benten

**Don’t always go for this combo.** Tribute Benten for Idaten to search for a fairy and a ritual spell. When using your search for a fairy, **don’t tunnel vision on Dakini.** Quite often you will find Petit or Senju will do a better job; they serve a similar function to searching Dakini with Benten, but taking the extra step thins the deck and gives you more levels to work with, leading to more consistent results. Even though you can’t search Saffira with Benten’s effect, you can stlll search for Senju which can search Saffira.

#### Unstoppable Fodder Theft

A tactic that is sometimes used to enable a ritual summon is to summon a searcher, use their effect to search out a combo piece, then use econ to tribute your lower level monster for their higher level monster and use their monster to ritual summon. The key to this combo is to activate your cards in the correct order. Consider this example in the CA mirror:

Opponent’s field: 1 Dakini, 1 Benten, 1 set econ

Hand: 1 Petit, 1 Dakini, 1 MAR, 1 econ

1. Summon Petit and search for Idaten.

2. Activate MAR.

3. Chain econ to MAR.

4. Use tribute take to get control of your opponent’s Dakini.

5. Use their Dakini as a tribute to summon your Dakini.

The defining factor in this combo is that you can chain econ take to a ritual spell, and since chains resolve on a last in first out basis, you gain control of their Dakini just in time for you to use it as tribute fodder. In this instance, **your opponent cannot stop your econ take with their econ because the only monster you controlled was tributed to activate your econ**. If you activate econ take before you activate MAR, your opponent can chain econ to your MAR activation, tribute taking back their Dakini, and preventing the summoning altogether.

---

#### Using Saffira’s effect

With Saffira becoming the new boss monster of the deck, many people may wonder which of Saffira’s End Phase effects is the best. Each effect has a use, but some are more situational than others.


##### Draw 2 Cards, Discard 1 Card

This effect is arguably the best of the 3. This effect is most effective early game to turn brick hands into playable ones. Don’t forget that discarding a card is not always a downside as you can discard extra Hymns to use as protection, or even discard Bacon Saver to give yourself a defense against OTK attempts.


##### Discard 1 Card From Your Opponent’s Hand

The most overrated of Saffira’s effects. If you can’t guarantee game on your following turn, discarding from your opponent’s hand is a poor option. This is because most decks run multiple monsters and defensive cards, so even if you can burn 1 of those resources they can have a second. Sometimes you may even hit a dead card and as a result the effect will have been a waste. Discarding from your opponent’s hand is best for putting your opponent in top deck situations and limiting their combos so that you may make a push for game on your following turn. For reference, here are some general rules/examples of using the discard effect.

- If your opponent has 2 or less unpredictable material. If they have set cards on the field but only one card in hand and no monsters, then discarding is fine as long as it puts them in a topdeck situation. If you can reasonably predict what their backrow is then you swing the game heavily into your favor.  
- If you are playing against REZ, discarding is ill advised. Most of the time they are holding onto their boss monsters and dead cards in hand and discarding them will leave the gamestate unchanged.  
- If you are playing against GB and they set two face downs and summon a monster, it is very likely that their hand is another gladiator. Do not go for the discard effect unless you first remove their monster on the field. If you can’t get rid of the one on the field, then the one in hand is less valuable to them anyway and you will benefit more from drawing and discarding.  

##### Add 1 Light Monster From Your Graveyard to Your Hand

This effect is most effective in the mid and late game where you want to retrieve an Idaten or Dakini from your Graveyard. In matches against slow decks/stall decks, this is also a strong option to speed up Idaten boosting so you can threaten lethal sooner.

##### Stealing Saffira’s Effect

During the End Phase, if your opponent will get Saffira’s effect that turn you can econ tribute take their Saffira and you will be able to use that effect instead. When doing so, your best effect to choose usually depends on whose End Phase it is.

On Your End Phase

**1. Discard from opponent’s hand**  
Discarding from your opponent’s hand will give them the least options on their turn.  
**2. Draw 2 discard**  
This option is good for getting protection into your Grave and for recouping some of the losses caused by the econ take.  
**3. Add 1 Light monster from your graveyard to your hand**  
Adding a light monster from the grave sets up for your next turn, but this implies that you will survive until your next turn. The mirror match is very volatile, so this effect should be saved unless you can guarantee they will not OTK you. 
 
On Your Opponent’s End Phase

**1. Draw 2 discard**  
This is your best option in most instances; you set up your plays for your next turn and can optimize your hand so that you can make a strong push on your turn.  
**2. Add 1 light monster**    
Adding a light monster is strongest when you know for sure you can get a specific combo off if you do so. This option is not as explosive as draw 2 discard, but is definitely the most consistent.  
**3. Discard from opponent’s hand**  
Seldom the best option. Instead of giving yourself options on your turn, you limit what they can do on their following turn. The problem here is that you are hitting their hand, but unless you have a Saffira or Dakini of your own, you won’t be able to take full advantage of this effect.

### The Matchups

The Meta has changed since the inception of this guide, and as such some of the information provided illustrates the meta constantly changing. While I have played and theory crafted these matchups, please remember **these are my opinions, not definitive representations of the game**. I presently am only discussing tier 1 and tier 2 matchups as they are the most prevalent in the meta. If any tier 3 deck sees play then I will add it later but for now these are what you will play against the majority of the time.

In previous iterations of this guide I have given each matchup a rating as to the theoretical win percentage and which deck would win more. Now more than ever I believe that win percentage against these decks is reliant on how optimized the build is and each player’s skill. With this in mind, **I will not be giving a numerical rating but instead will state which deck is favored if both players play correctly**.

---

#### The Mirror

Turn 2 is favorable over turn 1, but going first or second does not guarantee victory or defeat. **Econ is the most deadly weapon in the mirror** because it cucks Dakini, and even if your opponent plays around econ, you can tribute take their boss monsters and use them for fodder to summon your own boss monsters.

##### **How to Play the Matchup:**

+ **Going First:** In the past, going first in the CA mirror was generally considered disadvantageous. However, with Saffira and Hymn of Light showing prominence, the disadvantage state caused by going first is minimized. Double Dakini is no longer a prominent threat and therefore you are less susceptible to getting OTK’d. The best option is to summon two monsters, one to to wall out your opponent and the other to act as fodder if they go for a Dakini summon. During your End Phase, it is in your best interest to draw 2 discard to give yourself the most options on the following turn and to possibly put more Hymns in the Graveyard for protection. Keeping Saffira alive is important in the mirror, because she allows you to generate resources on you opponent’s turn.  
+ **Going Second:** You have the advantage; you get the first draw and the first battle phase. Your goal is to remove their control of the board and destroy their Saffira if they have one. Saffira will allow them to draw cards and set up for their turn so removing their Saffira is important for retaining control of the board. If you cannot remove their Saffira, do your best to remove as much protection from their Grave as possible while maintaining as much of your own as you can. You may be tempted to discard from their hand, however keep in mind that turn player Saffira resolves first, so even if you try to discard a card out of their hand, they have the option to draw more cards or even return the discarded card to their hand if it was a LIGHT monster.  
+  **When to Use Idaten Boosts:** An important part of the CA mirror is the Idaten boost. Knowing when to tribute and when to hold is a question of how much protection can you have in the Graveyard.  
    + **0 Protection:** it is better to not use Idaten for the boost and instead save her for your following turn.  
    + **1 Protection:** you should go for the Idaten boost. You lose if your opponent can boosted Dakini and Saffira with either protection in the Grave or a searcher on the field, however if you don’t go for the boost then they can very easily burn through your protection, kill your Saffira, and reduce your resources with less optimal hands. The only instance where not going for the boost is better is if they can summon a boosted Dakini and Saffira but can’t end with protection or a searcher on the field, but it is rare that a good player would choose this option as it is susceptible to a reverse boosted Dakini. If your opponent has certain options available to them you lose either way, but you lose to more options if you don’t go for the boost versus going for the boost.  
    + **2+ Protection:** it is best to go for the boost as your opponent will not be able to out your Saffira even if they can get out a boosted Dakini and Saffira. If they go for a ritual summon, they will trigger your Saffira effect which will allow you to draw 2 discard again or return Idaten from the grave to set up for a second boost.  

##### **Effective Techs for the Matchup**

[deck](Enemy Controller; Floodgate Trap Hole; Forbidden Chalice; Wall of Disruption)

+ {Enemy Controller}: Saves you from OTK’s, counters Dakini’s effect, and can be used to take enemy monsters to use as tribute fodder.  
+ {Floodgate Trap Hole}: Strong answer to Saffira. Doesn’t negate Dakini’s effect on summon, but stops her End Phase recycling effect, Idaten boosts, and piercing bonus. Not as effective as other options, but something worth considering at least.  
+ {Forbidden Chalice}: Chalice is good for cucking search effects, but is also great for Dakini’s effect. If your opponent uses Dakini, you can chalice to negate it, or if you use Dakini, you can chalice your own Dakini if they try to econ take. Has the added benefit of being usable in the Damage Step.  
+ {Wall of Disruption}: Since most CA decks do not run means to remove backrow, WoD is an exceptionally effective weapon in the mirror to punish them for overcommitting to the board, as it acts as a reverse Idaten buff. There is a case to be made that WoD is better than econ in the mirror, but econ is far more versatile and will be useful in more matchups.  

---

#### CA vs Red-Eyes Zombies | Even or CA Favor

REZ has remained a top tier deck for such a long time because of its versatility and space for adaptation. While they can run econ, only specific hands with econ can result in OTK’s. If REZ can’t OTK, then they almost certainly lose. While playing the matchup has not changed much since before the nerfs, I believe this matchup has gone from unfavorable for CA to even or favorable because of Saffira. Her draw effect simulates {Duel, Standby!} and gives you extra material past your first turn; the extra material is what was most effective about DS against REZ in the first place.

##### **How to Play the Matchup:**

+ **Summoning Boss Monsters:** When summoning Dakini’s with Idaten boosts, do so in defense unless you plan to go for an OTK. This is because summoning Dakini or Saffira in attack can often lead to econ take plays in the Battle Phase.  
+ **Recognize Where They Can OTK:** if you summoned a Petit in attack to search this turn, summoning your boss monsters in defense is your best course of action to prevent an OTK. If going second, recognize when they may have a {Curse of Anubis} set as they can change all monsters you control to defense position and swing into your weakened boss monsters.
+ **You Can’t Play Around Everything:** A bad habit that I used to have when starting with CA was trying to play around multiple different cards. If they have two cards set and one of them is a spirit, you don’t have the luxury to play around both {Enemy Controller and {Mirror Wall}. In some scenarios, you have to gamble on which you think they have, as playing too passive will allow them to set up for an OTK. If you think they have econ and don’t activate Dakini’s effect, then you should attack and force them to use it. If you think they have Mirror Wall instead, then you should activate Dakini's effect and not swing. What you should not do is think they have econ and not have Dakini effect, but also try to play as if they could have Mirror Wall and not swing.

##### **Effective Techs for the Matchup:**

Keep in mind that most of the techs that you would use against REZ are weak in the mirror.

[deck](Curse of Anubis; Cosmic Cyclone)

+ {Curse of Anubis}: If your opponent is able to establish their board before you can fully set up your defense, Curse of Anubis can be used as a backup strategy in the event your opponent goes for econ take. You get to stop the play and get your Dakini back, effectively wasting their econ.
+ {Cosmic Cyclone}: CC is the fastest option for CA; you can use it in the End Phase to snipe Spirits or econs.
+ {Duel, Standby!}: DS is not a tech card per se, but definitely improves the matchup. REZ is a reasonably quick deck, but when both CA and REZ get another material CA takes advantage of it much more. Summoning 2 boosted boss monsters is far easier with DS and as a result makes the matchup very difficult for REZ.

#### CA vs Gladiator Beasts | GB Favor

The Cyber Angel vs Gladiator matchup is heavily reliant on the build of the glad player’s deck. If their deck is built to counter specifically CA, then the matchup can be very difficult; I’d argue that Holy Guard GB is CA’s hardest matchup. If their deck is not tailored to beat CA, or runs multiple super rush/cards that aren’t effective against CA, then the matchup is becomes very simple. It is difficult to give a conclusive analysis of the matchup, but I think that GB is currently CA’s hardest matchup if they play correctly.

##### **How to Play the Matchup:**
+ Your goal in this matchup is to **put your opponent in a situation where initiating tagouts is too costly**. The most consistent method of doing this is buffing your boss monsters and forcing their resources.  
+ Watching for delays in this matchup is more rewarding than any other. Most of their cards can be activated at different times: super rush, they have a face up monster; Econ, you have a face up monster; floodgate: on summon; IA, any point in the Battle Phase; WoD, on attack declaration.  
+ Stopping their tags is important but you should know when it is okay to let them tag. **Summoning Idaten is a bad play turn 1**. If you go first, it is better to summon a searcher and end than to summon a searcher and summon an Idaten. If you summon Idaten, then you give them a target for murmillo.  
+ **Activating Dakini effect is almost always the right option**. GB don’t run many monsters, and unlike REZ they can’t swarm or resurrect themselves. If they lose all of their murmillo for instance, their tags won’t matter as much because they will have to contact fusion or econ take in order to get over a Dakini/Saffira.  
+ When going first, getting out Saffira is important to start generating material and getting protection into the Grave. The battle position you should summon Saffira in is wholly dependent on what searcher you summon that turn. If you summoned a Petit, summon Saffira in defense regardless of whether you went for an Idaten boost or not. If you summoned a Senju or did not summon a searcher, then you can summon Saffira in attack even if you did go for the Idaten boost. These precautions are to prevent them from going for easy OTK’s via econs in the Battle Phase.  
+ If they have a WoD, only having a single boss monster attack while another is in defense is good for mitigating the debuff. Remember that a boosted Dakini and Saffira are 3700 ATK and 3500 ATK respectively and when hit with WoD while you have 2 monsters they go down to 2100 ATK and 1900 ATK respectively. This means that you will be able to swing a boosted Dakini or Saffira over any of their Normal Summoned Gladiators.  
+ If you run Chalice, remember that you cannot chain it to their monsters’ tag out as shuffling back into the deck is considered a cost. If you want to stop the tag out, turn your toggle to ON and activate chalice after damage calculation. The game will not ask you to activate at this time if you have it set to AUTO.

##### **Effective Techs for the Matchup:**

Techs in this matchup are used to either prevent tagouts or to deal with backrow. Most techs are present to perform one of these two tasks, thorough explanations will be reserved for special cases.
+ **Stops tagout:** [deck](Forbidden Chalice; Enemy Controller; Bacon Saver; Curse of Anubis)   
+ **Eliminates Backrow:** [deck](Cosmic Cyclone; Double Cyclone; Fire Formation - Gyokkou; Greenkappa; Fenghuang; Lyla, the Lightsworn Sorceress)  
+ **{Gladiator Beast Andal}** Andal can be used if you are using a CA build that has econ. If they attack with their Gladiator, you can econ take it to tag out into your Andal. Andal is also at a good attack point value to wall out other meta Normal Summons.

#### CA vs Hazy | CA Favor

Of all the tier 1 and tier 2 decks, I have played against Hazy the least. However, of all the tier 1 and tier 2 decks, the deck that I have played second most after CA is Hazy. While I cannot give concrete opinions through experience, I have theory crafted this matchup and as I have played both decks I will give my thoughts on some more general decision making. I think that this matchup is slightly in CA’s favor, but can be troublesome as Hazy adapts to the meta.

##### **How to Play the Matchup:**

+ **Whoever summons their signature monster first loses.** When going first against Hazy, hold off on summoning boss monsters. Investing materials into a Saffira or Dakini too early can result in getting {Soul Exchange}d. Especially save summoning Dakini unless you can go for game or they have summoned their Sphynx first. 
+ If you use Saffira’s effect, beware that Hazy only needs one or two cards to get their combo off. Discarding can be good, but you run the risk of hitting a duplicate card or a card that will not be needed to get their combo off.

##### **Effective Techs for this Matchup:**
Fire Formation Gyokkou: Gyokkou allows you to pin a backrow and prevents them from chaining it. Xing allows you to pin 2 backrow, but is slower and does not prevent chaining. This distinction is important because hazy benefits from the smokescreen that beast rising and hazy glory give, and if you can narrow down what they have face down then you can very easily play around it and push for game.
Windstorm of Etaqua: Windstorm can be useful for putting hazy on the defensive sphynx has less defense than any of your boss monsters and cerb in defense dies to even petit.


### Frequently Asked Questions

When newer and less familiar players enter the CA channel on the discord, many of them ask similar if not the same questions. This section may see additions in the future.

>**“When I activate Idaten’s effect, when do I search a ritual spell from the deck, and when do I take one from the graveyard?”**

There are 2 things you want to consider when deciding whether to retrieve a ritual spell from the grave or get one from the deck:

###### 1. Do I want to have MAR in play?

{Machine Angel Ritual} is your best ritual spell. It can be searched by Petit, returned by Dakini, doesn’t require exact levels, and can stop a monster from being destroyed. However, with MAR at 1, you want to consider what you need it for. In the CA mirror, I would advise against pulling MAR with Idaten’s effect because keeping MAR in grave means protection and having MAR in the deck means that you can search it with Petit. In slower matchups and when you have all monsters in hand, adding MAR from the grave is good because you allow yourself to have a play on the following turn.

###### 2. How will this affect my next draw?

Knowing what you do and don’t want to draw will depend on you knowing what cards remain in your deck. If you have a spell heavy hand, use Idaten’s effect to take a ritual spell from your deck so that you are more likely to draw a monster on your next turn. If you have a monster heavy hand, use Idaten’s effect to take a ritual spell from your graveyard so that you increase your chances at drawing another ritual spell on your next turn.

>**“What is the best skill for CA?”**

I believe that {Balance} and {Restart} are the best skills for CA in the current meta and I have achieved KoG with both. {Mind Scan} and {Duel, Standby!} have potential but are possibly poor for tournaments as they can be less consistent than other skills and bricking is more fatal.

---

>**“Should I spend gems on [insert card]”**

Unless that card is in the core of CA, you don’t need to spend gems on it. Cards such as {Wall of Disruption} and {Cosmic Cyclone} are nice to have, but are not necessary and are easily replaced by econs.

---

>**“What are your thoughts on Anti-Backrow? (Xing, Nobleman, etc.)”**

On ladder, cards to deal with backrow are not needed. You should instead try to increase the consistency of your deck to win your most common matchups. For tournaments however, teching in 1 or 2 cards to deal with backrow can prove viable, but it depends on the format and what other people will be running.
