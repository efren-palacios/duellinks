<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overview</span></h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber Angels are the current best deck in duel links with their swarming ability and OTK potential. However, some players believe CA doesn&rsquo;t live up to the hype and believe they have solved the matchup. This mindset has been developed from inexperienced CA players playing mindlessly, or at the very least over extending. This guide will briefly discuss common plays, but the goal of this guide is to make you recognize possible options that are being neglected.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playstyle</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CA has the resource replacement of Gravekeeper&rsquo;s and the resource recycling of Lotus Harpies. The problem with most ritual decks is that they struggle attaining the necessary levels to bring out their monsters, resulting in relinquished being the only viable ritual build because of the low summoning cost and synergy with SK. CA solves this problem by searching out new material when you spend what you have.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing Nerfs</span></h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Will the Nerfs Affect CA?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you thought CA was tier 0 before, you probably think it will be tier 1 or tier 2 now. If you thought CA was only tier 1 before, you may think that they will be tier 2 or even tier 3. Let me make this clear in no uncertain terms. </span><strong>CA is still top tier in the current meta</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><strong> Just because you can&rsquo;t mindlessly win with the deck anymore doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s trash.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The nerfs to both MAR and balance are serious concerns, however I understand the necessity to do so. What was once a tier 0 deck is not tier 0 anymore but is still good enough to be tier 1, especially if REZ (CA&rsquo;s main contender) will also be getting nerfs.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Will the Nerfs Affect This Guide?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the nerfs will render some sections of this guide obsolete. However, </span><strong>the graphs, consistent decklist, and replays 1 and 2 will be kept until the nerfs hit so that CA players trying to get KOG can still have a reliable resource to do so</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sections that are for players trying to get to KOG and are not using the future banlist should look for &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pre nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; while players in KOG trying to improve should look for &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">post nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;. These keywords will be highlighted for your skimming convenience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Decklist Breakdown</span></h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">My KOG deck </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I must preface that I got KOG prior to the release of Servant of Kings and the news of the nerfs to CA. This means that my climb did not entail any Wall of Disruptions, or any doubts as to whether CA was a top tier deck. </span><strong>If you try to copy this deck, don&rsquo;t expect to easily get KOG</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The ladder in Legend rank has most likely become flooded with WOD, requiring you to play differently to achieve consistent wins.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">With those disclaimers out of the way, there isn&rsquo;t much to say about my personal build. Nothing spectacular or very flashy. I would definitely add a third senju if I had one while climbing, but dare I say I wouldn&rsquo;t add another sonic bird to this build. The econs win games in the mirror, and Cursed Seal on the first turn can shut down CA completely, not to mention its use against an opponent&rsquo;s econ. Cursed seal can be swapped out for another tech, it just so happened to be what was most effective against the ladder while I was climbing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Numbers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span></h2>
<p><strong>SKIP TO PAGE 6 IF YOU DON&rsquo;T WANNA READ</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following is a compilation of over 50 KOG decks of CA players and how many of each card they ran. Please note that these stats are to be used to help you get KOG, but will not help players already at KOG. This is because all decklists are compiled from KOG decks pre nerf, so anyone who is playing CA at KOG should be planning for the nerfs and not running decks that will be obsolete post nerfs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wW6BpB0t54zDtQ2cLin8K7agXfmjfsORsh5cqti4kdU/edit?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CYBER ANGELS DECK COMPOSITION</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this data, we can generate these graphs:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the first graph, you might assume that the &ldquo;Average&rdquo; CA KOG deck runs ~3 dakini, 1 idaten, ~3 benten, ~2 sonic bird, ~3 senju, ~1 angel, ~2 MAAR, ~1 econ, and ~3 MAR, leaving us room for one tech card of our choosing. </span><strong>However, this data does not give us an accurate picture of an optimal CA build</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example half of CA players may run 0 econ, and the other half may run 2 or 3 econ resulting in an average that is not representative of the actual population. Running 1 angel is not uncommon in these numbers, but most are doing so because they haven&rsquo;t unlocked the second one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking at the averages, we must consider the variance. What we find is that there is little consensus as to how many sonic birds and econ to run. We should instead look at the &ldquo;mode&rdquo; CA KOG deck, or the most common quantity of each card.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Consistent KOG Deck </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1T30XAPHSFHZwdRdsvaHBs6Tpw9SBG2wqmLqRQF7lQ/edit#heading=h.wvuk75h9dyw5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&sect;</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we disregard most people getting KOG without a second angel, we get the following decklist.</span></p>
<ul>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3x Dakini</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1x Idaten</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3x Benten</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1x Sonic Bird</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3x Senju</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2x Angel</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2x MAAR</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3x MAR</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2x Tech cards </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have found econ to be the most reliable tech card as it is useful in every matchup. I have also found success with &ldquo;Spell Shield Type 8&rdquo; and a few other anti-spell cards, but the main problem with these are their utility past turn 1. If you open with &ldquo;Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell&rdquo; in the CA mirror, you are nearly guaranteed the win, but drawing that same card 1 turn later will result in a brick, which is a huge liability when running CA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Skill To Run With Cyber Angels </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span></h2>
<p><strong>With or without the nerfs, I believe Mind Scan is the best skill for CA going forward.</strong> <strong>If you are still trying to get KOG, balance is an acceptable alternative</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The current meta is shifting back to trap cards, so knowing what your opponent is playing is all the more necessary. No other skill can provide as much information as to what your opponent&lsquo;s options are as mind scan, and the post nerf CA meta will require you to play around your opponent&rsquo;s backrow if you hope to survive. While balance has been generally agreed upon as &nbsp;the most consistent skill for CA pre nerf, the changes to balance will result in the skill being less reliable, but to an unknown degree. This change was also released with Servant of the Kings, which released a new meta changin card, WOD. Due to the lack of transparency between Konami and the playerbase we know that balance will be changed, but not how it will be changed. I will personally be testing the changed balance skill once it has been released and I will post my findings here; until then, run mind scan. The table below is a side by side comparison of mind scan and restart, two very popular skills for CA after the banlist dropped.</span></p>

               <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing what your opponent is running helps you form your strategy. Playing against ddraw hazy is different from playing against ddraw burn.</span></li>
               <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of WOD is resulting in a more defensive meta. Knowing whether you are free to attack or if a WOD will neuter your board is vital to surviving in the current meta.</span></li>
               <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running mind scan opens new avenues for CA; if you tech in a xing or a nobleman, your activations can be calculated and won&rsquo;t be shots in the dark.</span></li>
               <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While mind scan shuts off after you take damage, your opponent will most likely set back row before they attack as a means to protect themselves from a potential dakini summon or OTK attempt. Even if you only get mind scan for 1 turn, you still get to know what some of their backrow is.</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Tier CA Build Without Balance* </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span></h2>
<p><strong>*These builds are the product of theory and speculation; I cannot guarantee that they are the best builds or that there aren&rsquo;t equally strong builds for CA</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are what I believe may be the strongest versions of CA post nerf with only the cards currently in the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first build with nobleman will be better in the event that most CA players stick to playing CA. Nobleman will help retain speed through the immediacy of nobleman and econ to prevent OTK attempts through dakini effects. I showcased this build on Dkayed&rsquo;s stream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second build will only see use in the event CA becomes less popular. Xing will be better in a non-saturated CA meta because the number of backrow people play in CA is low, so xing would be be near useless in the mirror; most CA players set 0 or 1 backrow but xing requires two facedowns in order to activate. The main function of xing is to lock down backrow in a manner similar to seargent electro, as opposed to banishing the card outright. This attribute helps in a few key matchup: REZ, burn, hazy, and control. I will elaborate in matchups. You may wonder why this build does not run econ. The lack of econ will be a result of less CA in the meta, but adding 1 back might be better. This will all be determined by the shifts in the meta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something I want to specifically address is running nobleman over xing. On October 18, I ran mind scan CA with 2 nobleman and played against Dkayed on his stream. On the very next day, I saw numerous people either testing nobleman in mind scan CA, random people coming into the CA channel to say that nobleman is good, or other randos saying nobleman is broken in mind scan CA. </span><strong>Nobleman in mind scan CA is not the second coming of Cyber Angels</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I was simply testing one version of what I believe to be a top tier build for CA and nobleman just so happened to get me a quick win. Xing is arguably on par with nobleman in terms of viability as a tech; nobleman is good, but it won&rsquo;t solve all of CA&rsquo;s problems and cure cancer.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Core Cards</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trinity</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Angel Dakini</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Role: Boss Monster, Resource Control, End Goal</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dakini is the boss monster of this deck, but it is also </span><strong>the source of many misplays by CA players</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While many people will gawk at it&rsquo;s non-targeting removal effect, the secondary effect is often overlooked. During your end phase, you can return one MAR of CA ritual monster from your graveyard to your hand. In other words, you recoup some of your resources spent on getting your boss monster onto the field. Not activating dakini&rsquo;s effect on summon won me many games. In longer games, </span><strong>you get more value out of dakini when you use her for resource renewal as opposed to an all-in OTK machine</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong>: Recommended 3</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Angel Idaten</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Role: Combo Starter,Stall</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaten is used in the most common CA combo, tribute benten to summon idaten. This will be discussed further in combos.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong>: Run 1</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Angel Benten</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Role: Combo Starter, Combo Extender, Deck Thinning</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benten is primarily tribute fodder. Summoning her is seldom the best move, but it is much better against some slower decks.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong>: Run 3</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Acolytes</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sonic Bird</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Role: Search Ritual Spells</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When running balance, sonic bird is the least useful of the three as you are guaranteed a ritual spell in your starting hand and it does not synergize with MAAR to the extent the others do. However, it&rsquo;s inclusion is not to be neglected, and it may become more popular with other skills. </span><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong>: Recommended 1,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2 if you lack other searchers, 3 if you aren&rsquo;t using a consistency skill like balance or restart</span></p>
<p><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong>: Recommended 1 or 2</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Senju of the Thousand Hands</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Role Search Ritual Monsters</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senju searches out ritual monsters and can be searched out by the ritual monsters.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong>: Recommended 3</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2 is acceptable, 1 is ill advised but can work</span></p>
<p><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong>: Recommended 3</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2 if you need space for techs</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Petit Angel</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Role: Search MAR, Search Ritual Monsters</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel is the best searcher in this deck, and even though people have made KOG without 2, have both makes KOG far easier. Angel is instrumental in making some of CA&rsquo;s best combos. </span><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong>: Run 2,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1 can work if you are just starting out but will only get you so far</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rituals</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Machine Angel Absolute Ritual</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Role: Summon your Ritual Monsters, Restock your Deck</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This card can only be searched by sonic bird and idaten, and it can&rsquo;t be returned to the hand. </span></p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong>: Run 2,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Running 3 can work, but running 3 MAR is far more favorable.</span></p>
<p><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong>: Run 3</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You want as many ritual spells as you can get with MAR limited to 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>Machine Angel Ritual</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Role: Summon your Ritual Monsters, Protection</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Konami hit this card hard with the new banlist, and not without a good reason. MAR is overall better than MAAR. It&rsquo;s easier to get to your hand from the deck or graveyard, and does not require an exact level to use. It also protects your ritual monsters while in the graveyard, resulting in cards such as Divine Wrath and Super Rush Headlong becoming obsolete. I you are trying to hit KOG, run 3; take advantage of this card as much as you can.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong>: Run 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong>: Run 1</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Techs and Replacements</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech cards are an important part of CA in the current meta, but try not to tech in more than 3, otherwise you are more susceptible to bricking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Enemy Controller</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the best and most common tech card for CA and against CA. If you are missing any searchers, definitely throw in an econ or 2 as they help you win games.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tech / Can replace: Sonic Bird, Senju, Angel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Sphere Kuriboh</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SK is the second most common tech cards, and works well as a replacement. If AMA becomes more popular, SK will be a better tech card because AMA prevents spell and trap cards from activating, but not monster effects. Running 1 is fine, but running 2 may be a tad much. </span><strong>Don&rsquo;t run 2 SK just because of its secondary effect</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Relinquished was able to run SK because they are both level 1 and it was a free summon at no cost. CA can run SK, but all of the core monsters in CA are of even level, so using SK second effect of banishing from the grave won&rsquo;t get used unless you are able to get both SK into the graveyard, which is difficult enough because you can&rsquo;t search it with any of your monsters and even if you draw into both, you hinder yourself from bigger plays because they take up valuable tech spots. I would advise against running 3, but if you don&rsquo;t have 3 sonic bird or 3 senju, I doubt you have 3 SK. </span></p>
<p><strong>Tech / Can replace: Sonic Bird, Senju, Angel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Skelengel</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the pre nerf CA meta, skelengel was a f2p substitute for other searchers, but was generally frowned upon by better players as it was easily susceptible to a dakini effect or piercing damage. In the post nerf CA meta, skelengel may find use as a legitimate tech option in mind scan CA, but only if less people play CA. If CA becomes less common, then setting a skelengel turn 1 will allow for immunity from damage, since no other meta relevant deck can deal piercing damage or can consistently summon multiple monsters on turn 1 (except for maybe dinos through the use of hydrogeddon). If you start turn 3 unscathed, then you will have mind scan enabled, a 5 card hand, and a level 2 fairy in the graveyard in the event you need more MAAR material. This is rather hypothetical though, so if CA remains a popular deck then this tech may not be as great.</span></p>
<p><strong>Can replace: Sonic Bird, Senju, Angel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> &ldquo;Anti Backrow&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">xing zhen hu and nobleman of extermination are the current best cards CA has for dealing with trap and set heavy decks. Running these with mind scan will allow you to get the most out of them.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tech</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Floodgate Trap Hole</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floodgate is an overall good card; setting problematic monsters face down is best reserved for monsters with strong effects, not just monsters with strong attack.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tech</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Wall of Disruption</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WOD is the new and improved mirror wall. It heavily punishes over committing and mindlessly filling the board. WOD is strong in the mirror and has some use against REZ. Why this might not be the be-all-end-all card to defeat REZ is because REZ players are starting to tech in AMA to bypass battle phase shenanigans altogether.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tech</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Other Strong Defensive Traps</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curse of Anubis, Mirror wall, and Windstorm of Etaqua can be added, but vary in use. </span><strong>Curse is arguably the best of the three</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it can stop all-in econ take plays and the meta is not favoring normal monsters. These cards will help you stall until you can get more combo pieces, but I recommend a soft limit of 1 because stall cards don&rsquo;t really work towards CA&rsquo;s win condition.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tech</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> &ldquo;Spell Counters&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spell shield type 8, magic drain, magic deflector, riryoku field (someone made kog with it&hellip; somehow), the list goes on. If you find yourself with a low winrate going first, add one or two of these to your deck to cuck your opponent.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tech</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Anti-Magic Arrows</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMA is a strong card in the event that even more meta changing backrow is released. However, while AMA is a common tech in REZ, CA does not benefit from it to the same extent. REZ struggles more with mirror wall and WOD, while CA struggles more with econ, floodgate, and WOD. While there is some overlap, econ and floodgate are not restricted to the battle phase and as a result, AMA becomes a super aggressive tech for CA that does always guarantee a free attack. </span><strong>AMA does not stop monster effects from activating</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so SK and bacon saver can still prevent lethal attacks even if you use AMA.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> &ldquo;Spell Counters&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following cards are tech cards that had varying utility prior to the nerfs, but are either questionable or useless after the nerfs. Solemn scolding, cursed seal of the forbidden spell, and magic jammer are a few examples.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tech</strong><strong></strong></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common Miscellaneous Cards</span></h2>
<p><strong>Vennu, Bright Bird of Divinity</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By any logical estimation, vennu is a win more version of CA and should not be run. However, vennu has found success in CA in a DLPT and MCS3. These achievements can be attributed to worlds player Koizumi surprising everyone and proving that vennu can be run despite the possible consistency decrease.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sky Scourge Enrise</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the excess of LIGHT fairy type monsters in CA, some people have tried running enrise along with SK, or at the very least have attempted to do so. 1 or 2 players in the discord were able to get KOG with enrise, but this is a small minority and there has yet to be a breakout performance from a player running enrise CA, and I have my doubts that it will happen because of how the meta is shifting.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cards to Not Run</span></h2>
<p><strong>Super Rush Headlong</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super rush had it&rsquo;s use in the previous meta, but the monster removal dakini provides is far better, not to mention econ has more utility. This card is is terrible in the CA mirror because your opponent can banish an MAR and the result is usually crashing into a dakini.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Metalmorph</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metalmorph used to be strong against two of the tier 1 decks TBD and 3SD ninjas. 3SD would put them into critical health and metamorph could swing over for game, or at the very least prevent them from using 3SD. When CA came onto the scene, both of those decks dropped in viability, and so did metalmorph.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Divine Wrath</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divine wrath and similar effect negation cards can negate effects, but this effect is not as relevant in the current meta. In the CA mirror, your opponent can banish MAR and leave you with 2 less material.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sergeant Electro</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some players have have made mention of running electro in the past, but electro is bad in CA. Electro is a relatively weak monster that can only lock down 1 card at a time; Using electro will result in multiple instances where you attempt to lock down a backrow just to have him get destroyed on the next turn. CA cannot afford to waste card space on electro and have no consistent way to protect him. Electro also uses a normal summon which could have been spent summoning a searcher and setting up for a combo.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combos</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nerfs have hit some combos harder than others, but most are still possible. The nerfs have limited the use of combos to only allow for 1 MAR, and combos that rely on MAR being in the hand or in the graveyard are far less applicable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Idaten + Benten</strong></p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t always go for this combo (replay 2 </strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1T30XAPHSFHZwdRdsvaHBs6Tpw9SBG2wqmLqRQF7lQ/edit#heading=h.bwfgv3xjw8z2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&sect;</span></a><strong>)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Tribute benten for idaten to search for a fairy and a ritual spell. When using your search for a fairy, </span><strong>don&rsquo;t tunnel vision on dakini</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Quite often you will find angel or senju will do a better job; they serve a similar function to searching dakini with benten, but taking the extra step thins the deck and gives you more levels to work with, leading to more consistent results. Even if you can&rsquo;t summon angel/senju the turn you search for them, giving yourself combo potential on future turns is more valuable than starting with a &ldquo;winning&rdquo; board.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Benten Looping</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a plethora of ritual spells at your disposal, then consider this simple combo. Tribute a benten to summon benten. With your fairy search, get a third benten. Tribute the one on the field for the one you just searched. What did this accomplish? To the untrained eye, this was a waste of ritual spells, but if you give it some thought, you would realize that you are thinning your deck, resulting in a more predictable draw. Since you used most of your benten&rsquo;s and ritual spells, you will increase your chances of drawing into a searcher. This combo also leads into the idaten benten combo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> Dakini Bait</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This combo is rather obsolete now as it revolves around cursed seal, but it will be included anyway. If I start with a cursed seal in my hand, I will sometimes opt to have my end board be a single dakini and return a MAR to my hand with her effect. In the mirror, this baits the opponent to out the dakini, whether by econ or a dakini of their own, but playing any ritual spell will result in cursed seal banning them from using that card for the rest of the duel. If they you aren&rsquo;t playing the mirror, then using curse seal will help prevent econ shenanigans, and since econ is more relevant than ever in the meta, that will result in the other copies turning into bricks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Curse of Anubis</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Special thanks to </span><strong>Snowstar</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for his input and theory on this section.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curse of anubis opens up multiple combos and strategies that are currently underutilized.</span></p>
<ul>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curse of Anubis let&rsquo;s you switch all your opponent&rsquo;s effect monsters to defense and reduce their defense to 0. If your opponent has a field of 0 defense monsters, you can rack up damage with dakini&rsquo;s piercing effect. Benten&rsquo;s effect also deals damage equal to the </span><strong>original defense</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the monsters she destroys, so consider it extra damage.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switching your opponent&rsquo;s monsters to defense also has the added bonus of non-commital attacking. If your opponent activates a mirror wall, then you take damage but your monsters will remain on the field.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your opponent activates WOD, curse of anubis changes all of your monsters to defense, neutralizing WOD&rsquo;s effect.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Unstoppable Fodder Theft</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tactic that is sometimes used to enable a ritual summon is to summon a searcher, use their effect to search out a combo piece, then use econ to tribute your lower level monster for their higher level monster and use their monster to ritual summon. The key to this combo is to activate your cards in the correct order. Consider this example in the CA mirror:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponent&rsquo;s field: 1 dakini, 1 benten, 1 set econ</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand: 1 angel, 1 dakini, 1 MAR, 1 econ</span></p>
<ol>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summon petit and search for idaten.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activate MAR.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chain econ to MAR.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use tribute take to get control of your opponent&rsquo;s dakini.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use their dakini as a tribute to summon your dakini.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The defining factor in this combo is that you can chain econ take to a ritual spell, and since chains resolve on a last in first out basis, you gain control of their dakini just in time for you to use it as tribute fodder. In this instance, </span><strong>your opponent cannot stop your econ take with their econ because the only monster you controlled was tributed to activate your econ</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you activate econ take before you activate MAR, your opponent can chain econ to your MAR activation, tribute taking back their dakini, and preventing the summoning altogether.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Recycling Cyber Angels</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Full credit goes to </span><strong>Allen</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this section</span></p>
<ol>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need 2 dakinis on the field (the most optimal play would be summoning idaten with benten to add more spells/monster cards in your hand before summoning dakini)</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continue recycling by activating dakini's effect during the end turn and retrieving idaten and a ritual spell card in the graveyard</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the third monster field to summon idaten then summon benten using it as fodder consecutively (use benten's effect to grab more bentens in the deck)</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be an instance that you will ran out of spell cards, before that happens make sure you summon another dakini then use it as ritual fodder to summon idaten or end turn to replenish resources from the graveyard</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy as your enemy struggle as your monster gets thicc-er and T-H-I-C-C-E-R </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P.S. Save your dakinis by not activating her effect or attacking on pvp when you only have one </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> Double Benten Tribute</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (can be done Post Nerf, but far more situational)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is generally a good idea to not waste levels when ritual summoning, however this rule should not be held 100% of the time. This point is illustrated in replay 2 </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1T30XAPHSFHZwdRdsvaHBs6Tpw9SBG2wqmLqRQF7lQ/edit#heading=h.bwfgv3xjw8z2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&sect;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose this example going second:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand: 1 Dakini, 2 Benten, 2 MAR</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Matchups</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Meta has changed since the inception of this guide, and as such some of the information provided illustrates the meta constantly changing. While I have played and theory crafted these matchups, please remember </span><strong>these are my opinions, not definitive representations of the game</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mirror 50-50</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn 2 is favorable over turn 1, but going first or second does not guarantee victory or defeat. </span><strong>Econ is the most deadly weapon in the mirror</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it cucks Dakini, and even if your opponent plays around econ, you can tribute take their dakini and use it for fodder to summon your own dakini.</span></p>
<p><strong>How to Play the Matchup:</strong></p>
<ul>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Going first:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> going first in the CA mirror is widely considered a disadvantage. You want to set up a solid defense and be prepared for your opponent to be able to summon a dakini turn 1. Your end board should have at least two monsters. Summoning dakini on the first turn is a questionable decision, however it can sometimes be the best play if you have a strong backrow card and a searcher as defense.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Going second:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You have the advantage; you get the first draw and the first battle phase. Your goal going second is to be aware of when your opponent&rsquo;s face downs can be activated. If they can chain to a monster summon, but not to a spell card activation, they most likely have a floodgate. Keep this in mind when deciding which monsters to ritual summon. If they don&rsquo;t have backrow, try to go for dakini. Boosting her with idaten is a plus, but not necessary. If you can&rsquo;t OTK, try to follow some of the same rules as going first: have at least two monsters on the field to defend against an opponent&rsquo;s dakini.</span></li>

You either negate the card, or your opponent drops another spell in their hand. Most of the time, if they have another spell in their hand, negating the first one with a wouldn&rsquo;t stop the second spell anyway.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Curse of Anubis: Can be used to stall a turn, or set up or an OTK. 0 defense monsters are also susceptible to piercing; something to keep in mind.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell: shuts down an entire ritual spell, meaning your opponent has to have a access to their other spell if they hope to win.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CA vs Red-Eyes Zombies 45-55 REZ</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">REZ remains tier 1 despite CA&rsquo;s existence because of its versatility and space for adaptation. They have the ability to run 3 or 4 tech cards against CA alone and still pose a threat to non-CA decks. I could even see this as a 40-60 matchup in REZ favor if they start to run cards like Magic Drain or the like. Trap cards were the meta in the previous format, but CA has sped the game up so that countering traps is not worth the cardspace, indirectly buffing REZ. If you run floodgate, always consider REZ face downs before using. If they have a red-eyes spirit at their disposal, consider using floodgate on their gozuki to prevent milling and set up for an OTK. If they already have 3 REZD in play, use floodgate on a REZD to both prevent beatdown plays and clog their field. Since the monster will be in defense, mirror wall will only do damage if you attack and you can save your monster next turn with a MAR. Be warned, immediately using floodgate against REZD is a bad idea, because they can tribute summon another REZD or an econ take, leading into a possible red-eyes spirit and beatdown play, which will either eliminate your MAR in the grave or trash your board completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chink in REZ armor is in their playmaker, REZD. It can only be summoned so many times and requires a far amount of setup unless they start with insight, whereas CA can in theory stall for as long as they need to and can pull out playmakers turn 1. The problem arises when you have to out their REZD despite numerous defensive options that counter your attacks and dakini summons. If CA is to overthrow REZ, a lot of time will have to be spent in R&amp;D.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, the nerfs to both decks might not change the matchup rating, but it definitely hasn&rsquo;t gotten easier for CA. The main threat in this matchup is REZD, but with spirit at two, REZ players are going to have to reduce their insight count to prevent bricking. With less opportunity to summon their main playmaker, CA will have an easier time dealing with gozuki and samurai skull, since they won&rsquo;t be able to trigger beatdown. However, the nerf to balance and the addition of WOD has made mind scan the best skill for CA, decreasing consistency. REZ are still running econ, so the main difference between pre and post nerf is that both decks are more susceptible to bricking, but CA more so.</span></p>
<p><strong>How to Play the Matchup:</strong></p>
<ul>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> Aggressive:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The viability of playing aggro against REZ is dependent on what duel skill you are running. If you have are running balance, then doing so will be difficult because of how they play their backrow. When have 3 cards facedown and your opponent is able to activate one of them, you have little to no information as to if they have enemy controller or not. If you are running mind scan, then this matchup will be less of an exercise in guessing and more an exercise in planning. You will have to use your xing or nobleman wisely; don&rsquo;t target a mirror wall or spirit because they will be able to chain to it. If you can, try to lock down or banish cards so that you can gain field control. Your goal can be to otk them, but it is also important to set up a field with at least 1 dakini and use her to regenerate resources and trigger more dakini summons and idaten buffs.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> Defensive:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Playing defensive against REZ is difficult and requires a decent amount of setup. You goal is to bring out dakini, boost it with multiple idatens effects, and protect it from enemy controllers. This playstyle does well against a standard REZ build, but can falter when matched up with REZ builds that run unconventional or non-meta cards. Cursed seal and spell shield are the most effective cards for this playstyle. Step one is to bring out dakini, preferably with an idaten boost. If you have a cursed seal in you backrow, then you are guaranteed the win if you play correctly. Your following turns should be spent recycling material from the grave, tributing idaten for a second dakini, and tributing a benten for an idaten, grabbing a spell fro the grabe, and tributing idaten for a benten. </span><strong>Once you have your board set up, don&rsquo;t activate your search effects to get cards from the deck</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Doing so will most likely result in you decking out before you can get the win. Once your dakinis have attack great than double REZD&rsquo;s attack, feel free to swing into your opponent&rsquo;s monsters.</span></li>

<p><strong>Effective Tech Cards for the Matchup:</strong></p>
<ul>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Xing Zhen Hu: The nerfs will make xing a strong tech against REZ with the nerfs. If a REZ player sets two spirits turn 1 while not having 2 REZD in the grave, you can target both and cut off half of their striking power. If you hit a WOD and a floodgate, you clog their backrow and leave them with only 1 spot left which is susceptible to a second xing. </span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nobleman of Extermination: Similar to xing, but is more immediate and can only take out 1 backrow. It does banish all copies of a trap in both players decks, but it will miss other copies in either players hand or field.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wall of Disruption : This card has been released very recently and has already become a serious threat to both REZ and CA. Be warned that WOD may not be the definitive anti-REZ card that it was hyped to be. Their over-aggressive swarming style.gets hard countered by this card, but many good REZ players are already teching in AMA as a workaround.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell: If you negate one econ, you negate them all. If you&rsquo;ve done this, then your victory is nearly guaranteed, as you can usually loop idaten, dakini, or even deck them out. </span><strong>This card is bad post nerf</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">; you only have 1 MAR and are less likely to have the opportunity to recycle it.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Spell Shield Type 8: The main function of this card will be to stop econ plays. A strong 1 for 1, and it&rsquo;s guaranteed as opposed to magic drain.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Curse of Anubis: If your opponent is able to establish their board before you can fully set up your defense, curse of anubis can be used as a backup strategy in the event your opponent goes for econ take. You get to stop the play and get your dakini back, effectively wasting their econ.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Magic Drain: Like other techs, magic drain stops econ plays, but is not as good as it is in the CA mirror because REZ players are more likely to have spare red-eyes insights in hand and can be used as fodder.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CA vs Burn 40-60 Burn</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burn has been historically viewed as &ldquo;less thought intensive&rdquo; or &ldquo;braindead&rdquo; and has not found much success since the WCQ and restructer revolution becoming the first limited card. New-age burn focuses less on card effect chip damage and instead turns the strength of the top decks into a weakness. This deck is arguably the hardest matchup for CA, but intelligent decision making will improve your winrate.</span></p>
<p><strong>How to Play the Matchup:</strong></p>
<ul>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When playing against burn, hold back on summoning dakini.</strong></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your best monster is usually benten; her attack is higher than swordswoman, and if swordswoman dies to a benten, she deals 1600 damage to your opponent.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaten is also an acceptable but not as effective as benten.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dakini should be reserved for tributing a lava golem and/or removing any large tokens that were spawned from golden apples.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they activate massivemorph on dakini and crash with swordswoman, you will take 3900 points of damage. Keep this in mind any time you are tempted to summon dakini.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effective Tech Cards for this Matchup:</strong></p>
<ul>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Xing Zhen Hu: Xing was a good card in the matchup before, but there was no way to justify the inclusion as it was mostly useless in the mirror. The addition of WOD has made xing more useful in general, so adding xing is now justified.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nobleman of Extermination: Nobleman can help you remove all copies a a specific trap. If you open with it going second, you can bar your opponent from using an essential defensive card such as massivemorph or golden apples.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Enemy Controller: Econ is used for stopping singular attacks so you can attack into those defense position monsters.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Curse of Anubis: Use this card to stop literally any and all attacks. This card is best saved to neutralize aggressive swordswoman plays and stop skystarray from chipping away from your life points.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Anti-Magic Arrows: AMA trashes burn. The only reason CA shouldn&rsquo;t run this card is because AMA has limited value in other matchups &nbsp;when compared to econ, and is nearly useless in the CA mirror.</span></li>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Nerf</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Forbidden Chalice: Chalice negates a monster&rsquo;s effect, so if your opponent tries to crash with swordswoman, you can flip the OTK. However, this card has limited use outside this matchup, so </span><strong>don&rsquo;t run it unless burn becomes popular</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CA vs Hazy Flame BR 60-40* CA</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the nerfs to both CA and REZ, hazy has not seen a rise in success and may possibly die out. The problem with the deck is that it has always struggled with consistency. Hazy players have to hope and pray that they start with some way to summon hazy, or a monster at the very least. If they don&rsquo;t, gg. If they do, then prepare yourself for an uphill battle. They have a slight advantage if they can get hazy out with multiple backrow, but the lack of consistency is what keeps hazy from winning this matchup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*If they get out hazy, then the matchup is 50-50, maybe 55-45 in their favor. If they don&rsquo;t/can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s around 65-35 CA.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CA vs Mill 85-15* CA</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Against pure mill and old mill decks, pre-nerf CA has a 95-5 matchup in CA favor. However, new mill decks are mixing in burn cards so that they aren&rsquo;t guaranteed the loss. Honestly, you shouldn&rsquo;t be losing to mill, but if you brick, or they floodgate all of your monsters and you don&rsquo;t have any options, then there is a slim chance that you could lose if the stars align for them. Just make sure you don&rsquo;t mill yourself too hard, otherwise you&rsquo;re doing their job for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Theoretically, mill loses every time. Realistically, they may win 10~20% of the time against an inexperienced CA player. </span><strong>Pre Nerf</strong><strong> is 95-5 and </strong><strong>Post Nerf</strong><strong> 85-15</strong></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Questions and Misconceptions</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is most just some thoughts that I&rsquo;ve had or things I&rsquo;ve read that should be mentioned. I may add more as time goes on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;CA are braindead&rdquo;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;You have to play CA if you want to win&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber Angels are the current best deck. No other deck has taken the meta by storm to the extent that CA have, and have resulted in such a swift response from Konami. However, if you don&rsquo;t learn how to beat them, then you don&rsquo;t deserve to win anyway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><strong>This decklist is the best CA build</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">/ the optimal CA build/ the only viable CA build&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decklist provided in this write up is most certainly not the best build for CA, nor is it the only way to run CA. What it is, is the synthesis of theory and over 50 KOG decks, decks that have proven to work. The best possible CA build is most likely not known, or at the very least is not known to be the best CA build. Finding it will be the byproduct of theorycrafting and playtesting, so if you don&rsquo;t want to run the provided decklist that is perfectly fine, and in some ways encouraged. Thinking outside the box will be the only way to perfect CA.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;When it says &lsquo;</span><strong>2 tech cards</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo; do I have to use only tech cards?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The provided decklist states that the mode kog deck from the DL discord runs two tech cards, but that is just inferenced from the rest of the cards in the deck. Many people are running econ, but it is also acceptable to throw in another sonic bird, MAAR, or something of that nature if you are so inclined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Is running </span><strong>restart</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just as good as </span><strong>balance</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bricking with balance is nigh impossible if your deck is built correctly. Restart is a poor man&rsquo;s balance. </span><strong>Only run restart if you have 3 or less searchers</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Restart is used to make brick heavy deck brick less, but seeing as CA is the most consistent deck in the meta, you should run Beatdown or Master of Rites II if you wanna be a hipster. If you are running restart because you don&rsquo;t have balance, stop running restart and level Mako to 20.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If I can use </span><strong>MAR or MAAR</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then it doesn&rsquo;t really matter which I pick&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have MAR and MAAR in your hand, and both are usable, you may find yourself thinking that MAR and MAAR are interchangeable; this is not the case. If you have the option to use MAAR or MAR, it is better to use MAR and hold onto MAAR for later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: Hand: 1 MAR, 1 MAAR, 1 Idaten, and 1 Benten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goal: Summon a Dakini and be prepared for opponent&rsquo;s next turn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOTE: Neither option is the optimal play, but are used to illustrate a point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Option 1: Use MAAR</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summon Idaten by tributing Benten, getting you 1 fairy search and 1 spell search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Angel and MAAR</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summon Angel and search Dakini</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summon Dakini using MAAR, Angel, and Benten in grave</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combo ends</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand: MAR</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GY: 2 MAAR</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Option 2: Use MAR</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summon Idaten by tributing Benten, getting you 1 fairy search and 1 spell search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Angel and MAR</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summon Angel and search Dakini</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summon Dakini using MAAR, Angel, and Benten in grave</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add MAR back to hand w/ Dakini, or leave it in grave &lt;- (Having the option to do so is valuable)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combo ends</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand: 1 or 2 MAR</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GY:1 MAAR, 1 or 0 MAR</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of your turn, if dakini is still on the field, you have the option to return MAR to your hand or not. This option is not given to you if you had used MAAR. If you opt to leave it in the graveyard, you can use it as protection later on.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;CA isn&rsquo;t tier 0 anymore, so </span><strong>CA is no longer the best deck</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CA is still the best deck, but by a very small margin. I have always believed that CA&rsquo;s main competitor, REZ, had a winning matchup against CA, so I am honestly not surprised that CA has been put into the same tier as REZ.</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replays </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre Nerf</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There aren&rsquo;t many so far but they both showcase specific and potent plays. The first replay is an in depth play by play, the second focuses on a few key decisions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replay 1: The Power of Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matchup: </span><strong>CA mirror</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5PeKP9imKAQeTZBWHRjRkxIRUk/view?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5PeKP9imKAQeTZBWHRjRkxIRUk/view?usp=sharing</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting hand: 2 angel, 1 MAR, and 1 Cursed Seal</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite starting first with a hand may be thought to be a brick, I illustrate the potential of cursed seal. </span><strong>The replay bugs out mid dakini summon on turn 3</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TURN 1: The double angel allows me to search for anything in my deck. In this situation, I usually go for a benten as it leads to the most options later on, but drawing out an MAR may have been the better option in this case, as I was most likely going to use cursed seal to cuck a ritual summon, and having a second MAR would be better than searching out a benten because I am more likely to draw a ritual monster than another MAR/MAAR. My reasoning was that getting a benten into the hand was a better move because I would be able to play slower once my opponent&rsquo;s better/searchable ritual spell was out of play, not to mention benten searches on tribute, leading to another monster search and summon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand: 1 angel, 1 MAR, 1 benten</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Field: 1 angel, 1 Cursed Seal</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TURN 2: My opponent summons senju and searches dakini. This could be a sign of an OTK attempt, tributing for dakini, and use effect because my face down didn&rsquo;t allow for response after he summoned his senju. He activates MAR and I cuck it with cursed seal, leaving him to set a face down (econ) and attack my angel. I opt not to banish MAR and he ends his turn. Now, while I may have significant card disadvantage, the advantage I have gained from Cursed Seal sets me on a one way track to victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TURN 3: I draw into idaten; </span><strong>you could call this luck, but this was a calculated success</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (more below). summon angel, search MAR, tribute benten for idaten, search dakini and MAAR, and use MAAR to shuffle the benten and angel in the grave back into the deck to summon dakini. </span><strong>This was a (minor) misplay</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (more below). For some reason the replay crashes at this point, unfortunately you&rsquo;ll just have to take my word as to what happens next. I opt not to activate dakini&rsquo;s effect because his backrow was activatable, then swing with idaten, angel, then dakini. During my end phase I pick up an MAR from the grave in the event I want to go for something next turn. This is acceptable because I still have an MAR in the grave from using Cursed Seal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand: 1 MAR</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Field: 1 dakini, 1 angel, 1 idaten</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TURN 4-5: He doesn&rsquo;t draw into MAAR, or at the very least doesn&rsquo;t have the correct levels to activate it and econs my angel as a conceding gesture. I win on turn 5.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CONCLUSION: CA is heavily crippled by cursed seal. In a duel where my starting hand was two searchers, I was still able to win because my opponent was barred from summoning his boss monsters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TURN 3 DRAW WAS CALCULATED</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: I had 15 cards in my deck, so you might think that it was a 1/15 chance for me to draw a good card (idaten). However, I could have just as easily done this same combo if I had drawn MAR, using my angel search to get idaten and continuing as planned. So that 1/15 goes up to 3/15 or 1/5 because of the 2 MAR in my deck. I could have also drawn into MAAR, so 3/15 goes up to 5/15, or 1/3 because of the 2 MAAR in my deck. However, if I drew dakini, I could have summoned angel, search MAR, then summon dakini or benten, then swing. While this might not have been as good as the previous position, it still leaves me with a solid board, so 5/15 goes to 8/15 because of the 3 dakini in my deck. If I drew another benten, I could angel search an MAR, tribute benten for benten, and benten search an idaten or a senju. 8/15 is now 10/15 or 2/3 because of the 2 benten in my deck. The remaining cards would be 1 sonic bird, 2 senju, and 2 econ. If I draw sonic bird or senju, I can summon them, search for a combo card and summon angel next turn to get a full combo. If I drew into either econ, I could summon angel, search an MAR, and set econ, stalling for the next turn where this whole rigamarole of probability can be put to the test again. My chances of a good draw may not have been 100%, but my opponent would have had to top deck into a MAAR on the next turn in the event that my draw was suboptimal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><strong>MISPLAY ON TURN 3</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: &nbsp;What I should have done was shuffle the benten in my grave and tribute the angel on my field. If he drew into a sonic bird, he theoretically could have summoned sonic bird, searched MAAR, summoned Dakini, not used its effect, swung into angel, used tribute take on my dakini, and had game. If I didn&rsquo;t have angel on board, he could swing into idaten then tribute take and swing, but I could banish an MAR and it would not have been lethal.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replay 2: Opting for 2 Benten Over Benten + Idaten</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matchup: CA vs REZ</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5PeKP9imKAQcjVaamc1N0dkSjg/view?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5PeKP9imKAQcjVaamc1N0dkSjg/view?usp=sharing</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting hand: 1 dakini, 1 benten, 1 senju, 1 MAR</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this replay, I display the power of double benten tributing over the idaten+benten combo. Most CA players will find themselves going for idaten+benten every time even when options such as double benten do a better job.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TURN 1: My opponent mills out a REZD with their gozuki and sets 2. REZ players should be using their mill to drop a samurai skull or a bacon saver to the grave because they can put up a proper defense. Destroying their gozuki can result in a REZD, or they can bacon saver to stall and hope for a good card on the following turn. </span><strong>If a REZ player mills a REZD, there&rsquo;s a decent chance that they have spirit</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The other face down was either a 50/50 between mirror wall or econ.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TURN 2: Given that I have senju, benten, and an MAR in hand, most CA players would summon senju to search for an idaten and proceed with an idaten+benten play. Instead, I summon senju and search out another benten. As mentioned in combos, tributing 2 benten for dakini can be better than tributing benten for a benten to go into an idaten, but tributing 2 benten for dakini can sometimes be better than going for an idaten+benten combo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I activate dakini&rsquo;s effect and both benten&rsquo;s effects. While you should play around econ, I would be able to summon another dakini even if he had econ. The key here is that in order to econ take, he has to chain econ to my dakini, benten, benten chain, and if he does that, I can change what cards I will search so that I can get another dakini out. Neither backrow gets chained however, so I deduce that the face downs are most likely spirit and mirror wall, double spirit, or spirit and a random tech card that wasn&rsquo;t useful. With this information, I use my two benten searches to search a benten and an idaten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, what comes next may surprise you, but I actually decide to tribute idaten for benten, and not the other way around. What we are left with is benten at 2800, a basic senju, and a 3700 dakini. If my opponent activates spirit, I can swing with my benten over a REZD and not risk my dakini. Even if there is a mirror wall, I can banish an MAR to save the monster, and since both are above 2700, my opponent can&rsquo;t use beatdown to to swing over. I first swing with benten, and I take notice that backrow is activatable twice, meaning that either his toggle was set to on, or he had a damage step card and a non damage step card. If toggle is set to on, then he could have had two spirits as it will prompt activation during attack declaration and battle step, but he ultimately doesn&rsquo;t activate anything in response so I assume that he isn&rsquo;t running double spirit and is probably running spirit and mirror wall. I think he has a mirror wall set, but I swing with dakini anyway beacuse I could banish an MAR from the grave as a backup plan. He pops spirit and summons REZD in attack, so I assume that my mirror wall assumption was correct. I swing anyway to force the mirror wall and banish an MAR. I didn&rsquo;t have much to fear because my benten reduced his life points to 1200, rendering mirror wall a 1 turn card. I return idaten during the end phase, but it didn&rsquo;t matter all that much, the game was to be decide on the next turn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TURN 3: He sets a monster, activates beatdown and swings. Senju was an attack and defense liability so I didn&rsquo;t save him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TURN 4: I swing into REZD for game. If he had an SK, I could swing with benten and benten&rsquo;s effect would do lethal damage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CONCLUSION: Don&rsquo;t think tributing benten for idaten is the best combo in CA. This deck is more than capable of getting wins and creating strong boards without summoning her.</span></p>
