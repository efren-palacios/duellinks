* **8k DA (Duel Assessment)** just keep destroying their monsters with {Gate Guardian} to achieve the "destroy 5/7/10" monsters achievement
* Not as consistent as a farm deck with a determined skill
* Holy Guard, Restart, Balance, and Draw Sense: Light are helpful, however.

**Strategy**
* Get {The Unhappy Girl} + {Spirit Barrier} on the field ASAP
* Hit their monsters with Unhappy Girl to prevent them from attacking
* Only have 2 Unhappy Girls on the field, don't summon the third
* Before the last turn, make sure {Temple of the Kings} is on the field and summon {Mystical Beast of Serket}

**Last turn:** 
		1. Use Serket's effect to summon {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon}
		2. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
		3. Use {Secret Pass to the Treasures} and both {Union Attack} on Vassal 
		4. Attack directly for 9999+ damage
	
**Replacements**
* If you only have 1 Union Attack replace the 2nd with {Spell Reclamation}

* Take 1500 Damage To Proc Draw Sense: LIGHT to draw Mythical Beast Cerberus.
* Summon {Mythical Beast Cerberus} and activate enough spells to reach a "Safe Point" (Enough attack not to be destroyed by opponent's monsters)
* Keep activating spells until you draw the last card of your deck.
