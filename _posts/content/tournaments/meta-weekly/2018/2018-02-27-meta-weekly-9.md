*Author's Comments:* "Me being nervous probably caused me to missplay since I've never been past round 2. [My] deck is pretty much the standard balance build but I mained 2 {Wall of Disruption} because I know it wins games. Aliens have been my favorite archetype since I started playing Yugioh so I wanted seriously [play] in tournaments now."
