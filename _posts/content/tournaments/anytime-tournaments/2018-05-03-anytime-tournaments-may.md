30-card Spellbooks were amazing. Went up against [Amazoness](/tier-list/deck-types/amazoness/), 30-card mirror, and finally [Geargias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/) to take the crown! Siding out two {That Grass Looks Greener} was quite convenient.

First ever Anytime Tournament after the new Box ([Visions of Ice](/box-reviews/visions-of-ice/)) conquered by Spellbooks! This Deck is absolutely insane and is definitely note worthy and one you should look out for. This is my personal OTK variant using {That Grass Looks Greener}.
Once I hit KoG with this deck I will make a detailed guide on how to play this meta breaking deck.
