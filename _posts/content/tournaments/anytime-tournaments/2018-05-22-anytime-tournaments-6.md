### Winning Decklists

<br>

#### May 22nd

#### Stevie
Played vs 1 Masked Heroes, 1 30 card Spellbooks (wonder who) and 1 {Grit} Sylvans in finals. Noble Knights are better than I thought. {Double Cyclone} is pretty good, shoutout to Nix.

Never even considered touching side deck, techs in to counter Spellbooks which is what usually knocks me out of these tourneys nowadays. No one made me sweat. Too eazy!

##### belie that
Didn’t need to touch the side deck. This, in my opinion, is currently the strongest way to play Amazoness. My matches were against a Giski Ritual deck, Amazoness mirror match, and Sylvans.

Honestly been my favorite deck since its release. Haven't had the same passion for a deck since REZ. Tried a few of these anytimes testing Amazoness but never pulled through to the end. Spellbooks is the way to go! Oh and the 3 {Last Day of Witch} never got used, just there because the most annoying match up IMO is the 30 card mirror. Everything else is usually a breeze when played optimally.
