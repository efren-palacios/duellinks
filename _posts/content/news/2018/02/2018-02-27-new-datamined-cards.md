### New Cards

Finally, **new cards** were found in the latest leak as well. 
(you can view the album of leaked cards [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/MZ92t))

***Syrus Truesdale Cards***

[deck](Drillroid; Super Vehicroid Jumbo Drill; Expressroid; Barbaroid, the Ultimate Battle Machine; Armoroid; Mixeroid; Super Vehicroid - Mobile Base; Gyroid; Ambulance Rescueroid; Jetroid; Pair Cycroid; Submarineroid; Steam Gyroid; Steamroid; Vehicroid Connection Zone; Stealthroid; Carrierroid; Truckroid; Decoyroid; Ambulanceroid; Patroid; Rescueroid; Cycroid; Supercharge)

These '-roid' cards will likely be used or dropped by **Syrus Truesdale**, as they are his signature cards in the Yu-Gi-Oh GX Anime. It remains to be seen which of these cards will be obtainable and which will only be used in the Legendary Duelist's NPC deck. Stay tuned for an event page featuring farm decks, strategies, rewards, and reviews once the event begins!

***Duel Island Reward Cards***

[deck](Golden Homunculus; Dark Crusader; The Statue of Easter Island; Space Mambo)

These new cards were some of the rewards for the newest [Duel Island](/events/february-2018/duel-island-gladiator/) event. Visit the event page to find out more, including decklists, strategy, and rewards!
