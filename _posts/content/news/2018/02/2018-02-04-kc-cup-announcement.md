### Stage 1
* The first stage of the KC cup plays very similar to the **ranked ladder**
* For the November 2017 KC Cup, players raised their DLv by dueling, up to a **max level of 20**
* Reaching stage 20 qualifies a player for **stage 2** of the KC Cup
* **Gems, tickets, and gold** were given to players as rewards for increasing their DLv

### Stage 2
* Stage 2 of the KC Cup follows an **ELO system**, with points gained/lost for each win or loss
* Based on a player's **global ranking** at the end of the event, they will receive a certain amount of tickets as well as other rewards
* The **top 500 players** of each region will be eligible to play in the **Regional Representative Qualifiers** for WCS 2018, and be exempt from the WCS qualifiers
* Players who reached **KOG rank** for the 24th season of ranked duels (January) are automatically entered into stage 2, but **can still play** in stage 1 until Feb 15
