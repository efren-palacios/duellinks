## 23rd February Update

The Card Trader's inventory has been updated with some new additions to his card pool! 

[deck](Archfiend Giant; Fish and Swaps; Atlantean Attack Squad)

### Top Player Council Opinions

**{#Kayoh}says:** 

> {Archfiend Giant} could come in as a handy side deck card for Archfiends vs Water decks.

> {Atlantean Attack Squad} is 2400 ATK with {Hammer Shark} and {Umi} on the field so it could be useful, although I don't think the new water decks would play them.

> {Fish and Swaps} isn't useful with the current card pool.

### Required Items

- {Archfiend Giant}: 45,000 Gold, 6 SR Jewel, 50 Stone of Darkness
- {Fish and Swaps}: 15,000 Gold, 35 R Jewel, 35 Stone of Spell
- {Atlantean Attack Squad}: 18,000 Gold, 40 R Jewel, 35 Stone of Water  

### Summary

These new cards have potential in existing decks, but there's nothing game changing here.

***The Card Trader is unlocked at Stage 7 and the cards in stock rotate every 8 hours.***

## 7th February Update

#### By {#Freeska}

The Card Trader's inventory has been updated with some new additions to his card pool. This time we have received 3 new cards part of the 'Aroma' archetype, expanding on {Aromage Bergamot}, which we received in the last Card Trader update.

[deck](Aromage Jasmine; Aromage Rosemary; Aroma Garden)

### Top Player Council Opinions

**{#Whybona} says:** 

> There is some potential there to quickly 'out-resource' your opponent but the issue is where your offensive pressure is going to come from. There's {Aromage Bergamot}, but that's not too impressive when it only has 1800 defense as well as being in a meta where {Wall of Disruption} is really popular. This also means the deck would need ways of dealing with backrow. 
Basically the engine is there to gain resources fast but there's still some key parts the deck is lacking.

**{#Superforms} says:** 

> {Aromage Bergamot} is actually a pretty decent wall if you can protect him. {Aroma Garden} with {Aromage Bergamot} is a constant *3900*ATK/*3300*DEF beatstick with piercing damage, and with {Aromage Jasmine} you're going to be drawing cards every turn as well. I think {Aromage Rosemary} is more of a tech card (shutting down Endless Trap Hell stall decks, for example) than a main-deck card. The deck will likely struggle with consistency and will suffer from semi-reliance on a non-skill field spell, but should be fun to play around with.

### Required Items

- {Aromage Jasmine}: 42,000 Gold, 5 SR Jewels, 50 Stone of Light
- {Aromage Rosemary}: 17,000 Gold, 35 R Jewel, 35 Stone of Spell 
- {Aroma Garden}: 6,000 Gold, 2 Stone of Spell

### Summary

The cards we've received so far have potential as a standalone deck, but are still missing key ingredients which will possibly prevent them from being competitive. However, they seem decent as a more fun deck. Keep on the lookout for more Aroma support in the future!
