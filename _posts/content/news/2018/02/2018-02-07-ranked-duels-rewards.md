### New Cards

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/408795629050003477/410908639885393931/List_of_Cards.PNG)

#### The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion
Evaluation - Potential

One of the main strengths of {The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion} is how easy it is to slot into decks that can support it. Ojamas is an example of how you can take advantage of {The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion}. Using the ability of {Ojama Country} to special summon any Ojama then following up with {The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion} let see you get an easy {Ojama Knight}. There could also be potential in a fully dedicated Union deck. Using {Frontline Base} can let you turn one summon monsters such as {XZ-Tank Cannon}.  While the union archetype is fragile at this current point in the meta, a little more support could push this deck to the tier list. In the end, {The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion} and the other Hex-Seals are cards to keep an eye on. They all have potential and one card can push any of them to top tier.

#### Dark Catapulter 
Evaluation - Bad

{Dark Catapulter} requires too much set up to be good in any meta. The requirements for getting one counter is already hard enough; getting three counters to clear a full back-row is impossible. The card, however, does have synergy with graveyard resurrection cards such as {Regretful Rebirth} as it protects {Dark Catapulter} from enemy monster's attacks if activated at the end phase. This clearly does not allow the card to be played competitively. Lastly, the fact that this card is a machine type monster and level four means it competes in the same slot as {Sergeant Electro}. {Sergeant Electro} has a similar effect but instead of destroying your opponent's spells/traps, it pins them down. The effect is immediate, requires no set up, and {Sergeant Electro} has more attack. There is no reason to be running {Dark Catapulter} over {Sergeant Electro} in any metagame and this will most likely will never change.

#### Necklace of Command
Evaluation - Bad

{Necklace of Command} is too slow and requires too much set up for both of its modes. Since it has to be destroyed by battle; the card you draw isn't effective until your next turn. Discarding randomly is also not very useful since you are using two cards (whatever monster and {Necklace of Command}) to get rid of one. Your opponent will still have more card advantage despite which mode you end up choosing. Another bulk rare and it will never see competitive play due to being slow in every aspect. 

### Older Event Cards Added

#### Dark Driceratops
Evaluation - Bad

{Dark Driceratops} is just a average tribute monster with the slight upside of piercing damage. It can be used in a budget dinosaur deck but there are better things to spend your tickets on. 

#### Destroyersaurus & Jurassic World
Evaluation - Poor

The intended reason to play {Destroyersaurus} is to get {Jurassic World} from your deck. This by itself is not enough to slot in the two cards in your deck. After using its effect, {Destroyersaurus} just becomes a 2100 beater and nothing else. Since you can start the game with {Jurassic World} by using Rex Raptor's Dinosaur Kingdom ability; there is no reason to run these cards. The only situation where the {Destroyersaurus} and {Jurassic World} combo is good is if you are expecting your first {Jurassic World} to get blown up. In ranked play this is simply not enough to push it to be playable. It has slight potential in a side-deck tournament but I wouldn't get any hopes high for these cards.

#### Amazoness Paladin
Evaluation - Playable

The problem with {Amazoness Paladin} is the end goal with the card. If you have two other Amazoness monsters then this card goes up to 2000 attack. I don't believe that to be enough to make {Amazoness Paladin} an automatic three-of. It also directly competes with {Amazoness Tiger}. {Amazoness Tiger} offers protection and ends up with 1900 attack if you control 2 other Amazoness monsters. {Amazoness Paladin} only has an edge against {Amazoness Tiger} if you only control one Amazoness monster. With all of that said it still makes the cut due to it working along side {Amazoness Tiger} and since you can only control one {Amazoness Tiger}. In the end it can be a good beater but overall the archetype is weak compared to dinosaurs. If more support is added in the future then Amazones can be a real deck.
