<br>

New information about the datamined structure decks (see the article below) has been found! 
 
The Destiny HERO structure deck appears to be called *'Destiny Rulers'* based on the promotional image. 
Also, text was found in game for the name of the Dragon Structure deck, *'Dragonic Fusion'*. 
 
In addition, the text for what could possibly be the new Chazz Princeton Skill was found in game: 'Begin the Duel with {Dragon's Mirror} in your Deck, and {Five-Headed Dragon} in your Extra Deck.'

### New Events

### 11th February Update

<br>

With another maintenance update comes new discoveries; **upcoming events and cards** have been found courtesy of XOF!

The drop rewards for the upcoming Dr Vellian Crowler unlock event, 'Dr Crowler's Tricky Tests', has been datamined. 
The event is expected to start mid to late February.

### Crowler Event Cards Leak

Files for what appear to be the new cards from the upcoming *Dr. Crowler's Tricky Tests* event have been discovered!

[gallery 2/3](/img/content/news/2018/02/datamined-discoveries/crowler-banner.png, /img/content/news/2018/02/datamined-discoveries/crowler-level-40-rewards.png)

<br>
<br>

**Note:** The missing card in the image above is {Biofalcon}.

**New** obtainable drop rewards found:

[deck](Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem; Biofalcon; Break! Draw!)

In addition, players will possibly be able to obtain 3 copies of {Ancient Gear Castle} and {Ancient Gear Golem} - previously only obtainable as level up rewards.

### Top Player Council Thoughts

**[Superforms](/authors/superforms/)** says: 
- {Biofalcon} is garbage. Cards that activate on battle destruction aren't even good now, and this is one step worse.
- {Break! Draw!} seems bad too since it's a card that would replace a protection card in the current builds, and that's not something a control deck like Ancient Gears usually wants to lose. 
- {Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem} could be used with {King of the Swamp} and {Cybernetic Fusion Support}, but Ancient Gears doesn't have any good searching power, and so you'd really just have to wait to draw into the materials. You could also run a Last Gamble build, possibly with {Spell Gear} but you would lose the {Ancient Gear Castle} provided by Middle Age Mechs.

### Meta Impact

The return of this event has some potentially important factors in the current meta which has a lot of players excited:
- New players will have access to Ancient Gear cards, which are the core of a current Tier 3 deck
- 3 copies of {Ancient Gear Golem} will potentially be available.
- 3 copies of {Ancient Gear Castle} will potentially be available.

**[Superforms](/authors/superforms/)** says: 
- A third {Ancient Gear Golem} is interesting, especially now that we get more {Ancient Gear Castle}s too. Of everything coming in this new event, I think triple {Ancient Gear Golem} builds have the most potential to be good.
Overall I'd say Ancient Gears are still a solid Tier 3 deck.

**[Nix](/authors/nix/)** says:
- Ancient Gears will rise after this KC Cup, take my word for it.

**Brenduke**, an Ancient Gear player who has reached Top 4 and Top 16 in 2 Meta Weeklies, says:
- A third {Ancient Gear Golem} opens up potential for more aggressive builds. The build could also run {Ancient Gear Beast} with {Soul Exchange} and {Fenghuang} support if {Ancient Gear Castle} is added. A third {Ancient Gear Golem} also makes {Spell Gear} (Crowler's Level 40 reward) potentially good but most likely remains a YouTube play.

### Summary

This datamine should leave new and old players excited alike. New players will get access to one of the most flexible and beginner-friendly decks, while old players can look forward to upgrading their Ancient Gears with new playstyles not available before. The new drop rewards are lacking, but {Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem} shows some promise.

***Keep in mind that much of the datamined information is speculation, and remains unconfirmed until officially announced by Konami.***
