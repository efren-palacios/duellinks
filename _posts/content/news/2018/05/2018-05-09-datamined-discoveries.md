#### Top Player Council Thoughts

<a name="q1"></a>

##### "What are your thoughts on {Paleozoic Hallucigenia}?"

<br>

**[Kwrowe](/top-player-council/kwrowe/)** says:
- A nice addition to the Paleozoic archetype, which could see some competitive play in 30 card {That Grass Looks Greener} Decks. But it's hard to see beyond that though as there are Quick-Play Spells like {Gravity Lash} that do the job better.

**[Whilipino](/top-player-council/whilipino/)** says:
- Card is decent. More Paleozoics are always welcome, but it won't put Paleozoics on the [tier list](/tier-list/).

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- 3 {Paleozoic Hallucigenia} makes Paleozoics a more playable engine that has a possibility of being splashed into [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/) Decks.

**[Glading](/top-player-council/glading/)** says:
- Useless!

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- Interesting card. Kind of like {Mirror Wall} for the people that don't have it.

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- Not bad. Similar to {Gravity Lash} as it lowers a single Monster's ATK but has the same effect as {Mirror Wall}. I would probably play Gravity Lash or Mirror Wall over {Paleozoic Hallucigenia} due to Gravity Lash being immune to {Rose Lover} and Mirror Wall affecting multiple Monsters and not just one. But this is definitely a boost to a possible Paleozoic Deck in the future once Synchros and Xyz are implemented in the game. 

**[AndyTsang](/top-player-council/andytsang/)** says:
- When Paleozoics came out I thought that this one should have came with it. There are still two Traps in the archetype that are strong but not in the game.

##### "What are your thoughts on {Sangan}?"

<br>

**[Kwrowe](/top-player-council/kwrowe/)** says:
- One of the best legal searchers in the TCG for years. It was restricted to one for many banned lists. However, the timing feels wrong for Duel Links. In a quick meta where there are many banishing cards this may struggle. But, if the format does slow down expect to get solid advantage from this card so I would still recommend trying to get it if you can afford to.

**[Whilipino](/top-player-council/whilipino/)** says:
- The card has the most potential in my opinion. I can see people using this in farm Decks, but it may be too slow for the meta.

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- It can search many cards in Duel Links, but it's too slow for most Decks unless you draw it within the first couple turns.

**[Glading](/top-player-council/glading/)** says:
- It has future potential.

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- Exodia (monkaS) so pumped. 

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- Good searcher but the card is much slower than before the [errata in TCG](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Errata:Sangan). Might be playable in [Amazoness](/tier-list/deck-types/amazoness/) getting {Amazoness Princess} faster. Though I personally do not see {Sangan} being played at more than 1 as most decks are already consistent enough and not many play with Monsters that have 1500 ATK or less.

**[AndyTsang](/top-player-council/andytsang/)** says:
- While it can search a large number of cards, I'm not sure how effective it will be. On top of it being nerfed from its [limited/banned TCG version](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Errata:Sangan). Duel Links is also 20 card Decks, so consistency is already increased, as well as 4000 LP, so games end quicker.

##### "What are your thoughts on {Offerings to the Doomed}?"

<br>

**[Kwrowe](/top-player-council/kwrowe/)** says:
- Generic spot removal that this game has been crying out for! But it comes at a big cost. The lack of a draw next turn essentially makes this card a minus 1. But being a Quick-Play Spell gives it some potential especially against [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/) and [Spellbooks](/tier-list/deck-types/spellbooks/).

**[Whilipino](/top-player-council/whilipino/)** says:
- Another form of removal that gets around {Rose Lover} is pretty good. Seems good in the Side Deck against [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/), [Spellbooks](/tier-list/deck-types/spellbooks/), and [Geargias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/) since it works more as a flex option compared to the other "{Raigeki}" based cards. 

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- Nice Quick-Play Spell, 1 for 1 face-up Monster removal. You can bypass the cost by activating multiple in the same turn to get only one Draw Phase skipped like with {Reckless Greed} or just OTK your opponent the turn you use it. May see play in Side Decks.

**[Glading](/top-player-council/glading/)** says:
- Top tier card, {Enemy Controller} level.

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- It's nothing crazy.

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- Great removal card also being a Quick-Play Spell, you can say it's already better than {Tribute to the Doomed}. With the downside of skipping your next Draw Phase, this card could actually be good in [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/) as they can use the effect of {Destiny HERO - Celestial} to draw instead. Though, other Decks like [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/) might not benefit from {Offerings to the Doomed} as much as Tribute to the Doomed. Tribute to the Doomed is considered a better option for [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/) allowing you to discard cards like {Rose Lover} and {World Carrotweight Champion} to the Graveyard to activate their effects. I'd say it depends which Deck you play to make full use of Offerings to the Doomed, but it's still a great card in general.

**[AndyTsang](/top-player-council/andytsang/)** says:
- [Spellbooks](/tier-list/deck-types/spellbooks/) may use this to help them win going second in the mirror match.

##### "What are your thoughts on {Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Gorilla}?"

<br>

**[Kwrowe](/top-player-council/kwrowe/)** says:
- This card by itself is nothing to shout home about with what's available in terms of Fire First support. However, if further Fire Fist cards are released then it could see some solid play in an archetype that was one of the best TCG control Decks that existed. 

**[Whilipino](/top-player-council/whilipino/)** says:
- Too slow. We needs {Fire Formation - Tenki} for this card to see any play.

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- It's a strong Fire Fist card, but slightly nerfed since we donâ€™t have a Main Phase 2 to use both of its effects on the same turn.

**[Glading](/top-player-council/glading/)** says:
- Useless.

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- Nothing crazy.

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- Another Fire Fist Monster I thought they should've released long ago, {Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Gorilla} is one of the better Fire Fist monsters. With it's ability to search a "Fire Formation" card from your Deck and onto the field to activate for next turn and its great effect of backrow removal if your "Fire Formation" card is dead on the field. But adding this card will, unfortunately, not make Fire Fist a viable meta Deck. 

**[AndyTsang](/top-player-council/andytsang/)** says:
- Okay at best.

##### "What are your thoughts on {Dark Elf} and {Axe of Despair}?"

<br>

**[Kwrowe](/top-player-council/kwrowe/)** says:
- Neither of these cards are anything special. It might be worth getting {Dark Elf} if you intend on playing Skills that require you to drop 1000 LP but beyond that I see little room for these cards in the meta.

**[Whilipino](/top-player-council/whilipino/)** says:
- {Axe of Despair} is cool for farming, but not for competitive play. {Dark Elf} is trash.

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- {Axe of Despair} is decent for auto-duel Decks.

**[Glading](/top-player-council/glading/)** says:
- Trash.

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- {Axe of Despair} is a mediocre card. Next one will be {United We Stand}! Power creep can't get much higher.

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- {Dark Elf} is trash. {Axe of Despair} is useful for the effect of {Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror}, but it won't boost the [Archfiends](/tier-list/deck-types/archfiends/) as giving them power will not help the consistency of the Deck and will instead just add more bricks.

**[AndyTsang](/top-player-council/andytsang/)** says:
- I could see a world where you {Cosmic Cyclone} your opponent and then attack with {Dark Elf} using {Titan Showdown}.

##### "Which of these cards will you personally make sure to get when the box is released?"

<br>

**[Kwrowe](/top-player-council/kwrowe/)** says:
- Would be good to have multiple {Sangan} for the future. It would also be nice to try {Offerings to the Doomed} but the other cards don't look too effective as things currently stand.

**[Whilipino](/top-player-council/whilipino/)** says:
- All of them because I'm a whale!

**[Glading](/top-player-council/glading/)** says:
- {Offerings to the Doomed}!

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- I'll probably attempt 3x of each as long as the pricing for this box isn't as wacky as the last one.

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- Personally, I do not open Selection Boxes, but if I did, I would go for at least a {Sangan} and two {Offerings to the Doomed}, if possible.

**[AndyTsang](/top-player-council/andytsang/)** says:
- I will most likely be skipping this box.
