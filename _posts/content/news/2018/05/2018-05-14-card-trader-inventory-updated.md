### 14th May Update

<br>

The Card Trader's inventory has been updated with some new additions to his card pool!

[deck](Crystal Raigeki; Gravi-Crush Dragon; Penguin Knight)

### Top Player Council Thoughts

#### {Crystal Raigeki}

**{#Whilipino}** says:

> Not enough to bring Crystal Beasts onto the [tier list](/tier-list/), but good support nonetheless.

**{#Xanxus}** says:

> This card is nuts! With {Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus} you can easily destroy a Monster (pretty good against [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/)). I expect this card in future [King of Games Decks](/top-decks/), maybe it's good enough to do well in tournaments.

**{#SelectMaple}** says:

> A nice boost small boost to Crystal Beasts. Unfortunately, this does not make Crystal Beasts become a top tier Deck. 

**{#Machdragon}** says:

> Crystal Beasts support, yay!

**{#SkillShot}** says:

> Nice card, the timing is interesting with a [new Jesse Anderson event](/news/may-2018/in-game-updates/) coming this very same week, bringing new cards and a new Skill for Jesse, we wil see where this pushes Crystal Beasts.

**{#3K All Day}** says:

> Cool idea but trash. Thunder Monsters have the same Trap ({Judgment of Thunder}) without the requirement.

#### {Gravi-Crush Dragon}

**{#Whilipino}** says:

> Not relevant.

**{#Xanxus}** says:

> Another card that supports Crystal Beasts. I dont think that it's playable at the moment because a 1 Tribute Monster in a Deck like Crystal Beasts will be slow and inconsistent. Use in other Decks is also unlikely since there aren't any really good Continuous Spells in game.

**{#SelectMaple}** says:

> Crystal Beasts tech card, I guess?

**{#Machdragon}** says:

> More Crystal Beasts support.

**{#SkillShot}** says:

> Can probably be abused with Crystal Beasts or {Ruins of the Divine Dragon Lords}, but the fact that it's a level 6 makes it not that good at the moment.

**{#3K All Day}** says:

> 🚮

#### {Penguin Knight}

**{#Whilipino}** says:

> May be a potential Side Deck card if Mill Decks become a problem.

**{#Xanxus}** says:

> If Mill came back this is a possible counter card, otherwise it's trash.

**{#SelectMaple}** says:

> Counter Mill xD.

**{#Machdragon}** says:

> Garbage!

**{#SkillShot}** says:

> Good against Mill Decks.

**{#3K All Day}** says:

> 🚮

### Required Items

> {Crystal Raigeki}: 50,000 Gold, 6 SR Jewel, 60 Stone of Trap

> {Gravi-Crush Dragon}: 45,000 Gold, 7 SR Jewel, 55 Stone of Darkness
