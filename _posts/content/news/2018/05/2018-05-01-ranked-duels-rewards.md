### Top Player Council Thoughts

#### {Dodger Dragon}

**{#Xanxus}** says:

> Trash!

**{#3K All Day}** says:

> More of an Auto-Duel Deck card than meta, so pretty bad.

**{#SelectMaple}** says:

> Can dodge {Ultimate Providence} and {Divine Wrath}, but this card takes away your Normal Summon. It's just another 1900 ATK Dragon beater with a low graded effect. Cannot see this being good in competitive play.

**{#Glading}** says:

> Try {Hey, Trunade!} instead?

**{#BuiltToTilt}** says:

> Very limited uses, it's an extremely niche card that likely won't see any competitive play.

#### {Big Burn}

**{#Xanxus}** says:

> Trash, but maybe future potential as a Side Deck card.

**{#3K All Day}** says:

> Interesting card, shows potential. It may be a good Side Deck card. 

**{#SelectMaple}** says:

> I would use {Different Dimension Ground} or {Crevice Into The Different Dimension} over {Big Burn}.

**{#Glading}** says:

> it is a good Side Deck card against [Archfiends](/tier-list/deck-types/archfiends/) right now and it has potential for future metas.

**{#BuiltToTilt}** says:

> This card is a nice Side Deck option against Graveyard oriented decks such as [Archfiends](/tier-list/deck-types/archfiends/) to counter cards like {Call of the Archfiend}. It has a niche over cards like {Foolish Return} and {Disappear}, as it banishes all monsters from the Graveyard making all other revival cards in the deck useless.

#### {Cold Feet}

**{#Xanxus}** says:

> Trash, but nice artwork.

**{#3K All Day}** says:

> OMEGALUL ðŸš®

**{#SelectMaple}** says:

> Trash!

**{#Glading}** says:

> The perfect card for Guns to make a video.

**{#BuiltToTilt}** says:

> Pretty God damn useless!
