### May 13th (Update 12)

<br>

<a name="121"></a>

#### [Syrus Truesdale Event](/events/may-2018/syrus-truesdales-road-to-duel-links/) Survey

Konami actively reads player feedback so fill in the event survey to voice any woes. If you felt there weren't enough UR/SR drops, drops weren't evenly distributed or perhaps lack of Gems got you feeling down - put it into words! You can also use the survey to write non-event feedback.
