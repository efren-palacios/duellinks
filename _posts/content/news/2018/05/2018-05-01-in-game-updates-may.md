<a name="211"></a>

#### Upcoming Updates
Here are some key points:
- Roaming **Zane Truesdale** will return "desiring victory" once again - c'mon Konami, let us obtain him already! 
- The [**Tag Duel Tournament**](/events/january-2018/tag-duel-tournament/) is making a welcomed return this time with GX characters, fingers crossed that Gems are as generous as the first event.
- Time for D.D. Tower: Dark Dimension. Will the boss reward this time be [Oblemirage the Elemental Lord](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Oblemirage_the_Elemental_Lord)?!
- **Jesse Anderson** will be added to the gate, you can check out his drops in out previous [event article](/events/may-2018/awaken-rainbow-dragon/).
- The **Espa Roba unlock** event is finally here. The "team event" is a "Duel Carnival" that we found in out [Datmined Leaks](/news/may-2018/datamined-leaks/) article, let's hope he brings {Jinzo}!
- And finally, [Syrus Truesdale](/events/may-2018/syrus-truesdales-road-to-duel-links/) is back, again.
