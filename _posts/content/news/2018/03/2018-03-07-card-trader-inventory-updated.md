The Card Trader's inventory has been updated with some new additions to his card pool! 

[deck](Swamp Mirrorer;Divine Dragon Aquabizarre;The Dragon Dwelling in the Deep)

### Top Player Council Opinions 

**[Superforms](/authors/superforms/) says:** 
The only interesting one is {Swamp Mirrorer}, the other two are trash. 

Potential uses:
- Red-Eyes Slash decks; can be a Warrior for {Red-Eyes Slash Dragon} or a Dragon for the {Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman} fusion, but can’t be equipped to {Red-Eyes Slash Dragon} from the grave.
- Hazy Flame decks; similar but slower than {Dynatherium} as a special summon and {Beast Rising} fodder.
- Dragon decks; sort of synergizes with the [leaked Dragon structure deck](/news/february-2018/leaked-structure-decks/) since it can be fodder for the Felgrand monsters’ effects and works with {Dragon's Rebirth} (serving a similar role to {Ruins of the Divine Dragon Lords}).

Overall {Swamp Mirrorer} feels like a nice (but slow) consistency piece in decks that rely on specific fusion or tribute summons to get going. Likely will not have an impact on the current meta but has future potential.

### Required Items

- {Swamp Mirrorer}: 110,000 Gold, 4 UR Jewel, 70 Stone of Trap
- {Divine Dragon Aquabizarre}: 39,000 Gold, 5 SR Jewel, 55 Stone of Water
- {The Dragon Dwelling in the Deep}: 15,000 Gold, 40 R Jewel, 40 Stone of Water

### Summary

- The sea serpent cards are bad and will likely have no place in current water builds. 
- {Swamp Mirrorer} has potential in existing decks as well as compatibility with the [leaked Dragon structure deck](/news/february-2018/leaked-structure-decks/). 

***The Card Trader is unlocked at Stage 7 and the cards in stock rotate every 8 hours.***
