## 23rd March Update

<br>

The Card Trader's inventory has been updated with some new additions to his card pool! 

[deck](Super Solar Nutrient; Confronting the "C"; Danipon)

### Top Player Council Thoughts

**[Superforms](/authors/superforms/) says:** 

- {Super Solar Nutrient} (SR): The only relevant Plant decks right now are [Sylvans](/guides/deck-types/sylvans-guide-intro-by-superforms/) and [Aromages](/tier-list/aromages/). Both can tribute {Rose Lover} with this, but neither has a good special summon target ({Aromage Bergamot} and {Sylvan Guardioak} are both level 6, and few Sylvan decks use {Sylvan Lotuswain}). Tributing a Rose Lover to grab another Rose Lover thins the deck and gets multiple Rose Lovers into the graveyard if Super Solar Nutrient is removed. Alternative plays include tributing {Sylvan Komushroomo} for to turbo out {World Carrotweight Champion}, or tributing a {Aromage Jasmine} for a {Aromage Rosemary}. It is not likely that this card will be used in top-tier versions of either deck, although it will be most interesting to test with Sylvans.
- {Confronting the "C"} (SR): The decks on the tier list that use their Extra Decks are Fusion [Destiny Heroes](/tier-list/destiny-heroes/) and [Gladiator Beasts](/guides/deck-types/gladiator-beasts-guide-by-brenduke/) which are both Tier 3. Pretty ineffective wall vs Destiny Heroes, but possibly annoying to Gladiators (being immune to {Gladiator Beast Murmillo} and walling {Gladiator Beast Essedarii}). Not a great card right now; maybe better in the future as the Extra Deck becomes more relevant.
- {Danipon} (R): Has to be destroyed by battle to activate its effect, which is unfortunate. It doesn’t have any great search targets either: {Grasschopper}, {Magical Merchant}, {Man-Eater Bug}; none of which are used in a top-tier deck.

### Required Items
- {Super Solar Nutrient}: 45,000 Gold, 6 SR Jewel, 60 Stone of Spell
- {Confronting the "C"}: 40,000 Gold, 5 SR Jewel, 50 Stone of Earth
- {Danipon}: 16,000 Gold, 30 R Jewel, 30 Stone of Earth

## 7th March Update

<br>

The Card Trader's inventory has been updated with some new additions to his card pool! 

[deck](Swamp Mirrorer;Divine Dragon Aquabizarre;The Dragon Dwelling in the Deep)

### Top Player Council Thoughts 

**[Superforms](/authors/superforms/) says:** 
The only interesting one is {Swamp Mirrorer}, the other two are trash. 

Potential uses:
- Red-Eyes Slash decks; can be a Warrior for {Red-Eyes Slash Dragon} or a Dragon for the {Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman} fusion, but can’t be equipped to {Red-Eyes Slash Dragon} from the grave.
- Hazy Flame decks; similar but slower than {Dynatherium} as a special summon and {Beast Rising} fodder.
- Dragon decks; sort of synergizes with the [leaked Dragon structure deck](/news/february-2018/leaked-structure-decks/) since it can be fodder for the Felgrand monsters’ effects and works with {Dragon's Rebirth} (serving a similar role to {Ruins of the Divine Dragon Lords}).

Overall {Swamp Mirrorer} feels like a nice (but slow) consistency piece in decks that rely on specific fusion or tribute summons to get going. Likely will not have an impact on the current meta but has future potential.

### Required Items

- {Swamp Mirrorer}: 110,000 Gold, 4 UR Jewel, 70 Stone of Trap
- {Divine Dragon Aquabizarre}: 39,000 Gold, 5 SR Jewel, 55 Stone of Water
- {The Dragon Dwelling in the Deep}: 15,000 Gold, 40 R Jewel, 40 Stone of Water

### Summary

- The sea serpent cards are bad and will likely have no place in current water builds. 
- {Swamp Mirrorer} has much potential in existing decks and in future as well as compatibility with the datamined [Dragon Structure Deck](/news/february-2018/datamined-discoveries/#dragon-structure-deck).
