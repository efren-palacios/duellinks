### New Cards

New card rewards for your Ranked Duel Tickets are now available!

[deck](Dynatherium; Rose Archer; Flyfang; Rabidragon)

*Note: Ranked Duel Tickets from seasons before March 2018 cannot be used to obtain these rewards*

### Top Player Council Evaluation

#### UR - {Dynatherium} 
**Evaluation** - Future Potential

[Superforms](/authors/superforms): '{Dynatherium} is future potential to the max. Turn 1 it’s a completely free special summon with no drawbacks. It might not have immediate use, but it’s so hard to imagine this card not being great in the future.'

#### SR - {Rose Archer}
**Evaluation** - Future Potential

[Superforms](/authors/superforms): '{Rose Archer} looks great against things like {Wall of Disruption}, {Powerful Rebirth}, {Red-Eyes Spirit}, etc., but the current Plant decks aren’t good enough for this card to actually push them onto the tier list. This is something with serious future potential if we get a Plant deck better than Aromages.'

---

#### R - {Flyfang}
**Evaluation** - Bad

Importantly, this card can be summoned with {Hammer Shark}. With {Umi} on the field (easily achievable with {Mythic Depths}), it becomes an 1800 ATK beater with piercing. 

[Superforms](/authors/superforms): 'Looking at current {Hammer Shark} builds, it likely won't make the cut.'

---

#### N - {Rabidragon}
**Evaluation** - Bad

Pretty much anything {Rabidragon} can do, {Blue-Eyes White Dragon} can do better. They are both Light attribute and Level 8. The minute differences in ATK/DEF are unimportant when compared to the support {Blue-Eyes White Dragon} has, such as {Kaibaman} or {Majesty with Eyes of Blue}.
