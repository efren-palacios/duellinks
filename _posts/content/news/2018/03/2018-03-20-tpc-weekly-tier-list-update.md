#### Notes by [Superforms]():  

* Sea Stealth Attack has been promoted to Tier 1 after continually doing extremely well in tournaments, even as the meta has adjusted around it. The most up-to-date builds use {Mythic Depths} as the sole way to get {Umi} (running no ALO) and fall back on {Abyss Soldier}’s and {Citadel Whale}’s strong effects in the event Umi is banished.

* Aliens have been trending downward, although they have remained in Tier 1 this week. Their bad match-ups are getting more popular (SSA in particular) and new decks like Sylvans can give them a lot of trouble.  

* Red-Eyes Zombies continue to perform like a top-tier deck, with the tournament representation and results to back up their Tier 1 standing.  

* Fishes remain in Tier 2, due to continued success in competitive events. In particular, Jason’s innovative strategy of smokescreen siding into Flying Fish from a semi-standard Whale deck has given Flying Fish a unique strength in side-deck formats.  

* Dinos, Gaia Plate Magnets, Cyber Angels, and Hazy Flame have all remained in Tier 3. Dinos, Hazy, and Magnets all placed in the top 8 in a recent 3K tournament, while Cyber Angels have a new toy in {Hey, Trunade!} and match up very well with Sylvans and SSA.  

* Gladiator Beasts have been demoted to Tier 3. GB matches up poorly with SSA and can struggle with Sylvans. Their tournament representation is falling and their results are lacking.  

* Destiny Heroes (Fusion variant) have been promoted to Tier 3 after numerous successful performances in various competitive events.  

* Sylvans have remained in High Potential. Opinions on Sylvans were optimistic, although many members wanted them to prove themselves further in tournaments before they are placed on the tier list.  

* Snipe Hunter Control has been removed from the tier list. This deck has not been seen in recent tournaments and is outclassed by a similar deck in Fishes.  

* This week we had the [Meta Weekly on 3/21](/tournaments/meta-weekly/12/report/), the Duel Links Open on 3/23, and the Duel Links Pro Tournament 15 on 3/24. Expect the results of these tournaments to have a strong effect on the tier list.
