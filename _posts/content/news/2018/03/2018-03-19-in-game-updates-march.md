### **19th March Update**

With the new announcements, what has been a fairly mundane month for Duel Links is going out with a bang! 

There will be a new Roaming Legendary Duelist in a few days, a Pick-a-Gift Campaign until the end of the month as well as a KC Cup announcement. There's no need to check your notifications, we have it all here!

### Roaming Legendary Duelist

The Superb Legendary Duelist has been revealed it be in fact Téa, you can read all about her drop rewards in our [Datamined Discoveries article](/news/march-2018/datamined-discoveries/)! Be sure to read our [event article](/farming-and-events/) when the event starts so you know the most efficient way to farm her.

### Pick-a-Gift Campaign

{Tethys, Goddess of Light} (SR) is a new addition this time along with {Double Attack} (R).

### Top Player Council Thoughts

#### **[Superforms](/authors/superforms/)** says: 
- Since {Tethys, Goddess of Light} requires no effort to pick up, it should just be compared to {Guardian of Felgrand} and {Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane}, the other two options. Kurogane hasn't been used in a top-tier Magnet deck for over a month and while Felgrand has potential with the [datamined Dragon Structure Deck](/news/february-2018/datamined-discoveries/#dragon-structure-deck), it probably would not be run at more than 2x since {Paladin of Felgrand} is better in most cases.
- Tethys has synergy with the upcoming Counter Fairy archetype and its effect is very easy to trigger (either from your normal draw or another card like {Cards from the Sky}; it also triggers off its own effect). Whether it can be squeezed into the best variant of Counter Fairies remains to be seen, but it's definitely a card with potential.
- For the R rarity cards you should prioritize {Cards from the Sky} over {Double Attack}, but if you already have 3 copies and a copy of {Sword of Deep Seated} (you’ll never need more than one), you may as well pick it up. However, it's pretty bad though, and the discard is for cost so unfortunately no Dark World synergy.

### KC Cup

It's already time for another KC Cup! So if you didn't perform as well as you wanted in the last one, or just want to continue to dominate the ladder and add more Prismatics Cards to your collection, get your deck ready and secure your invitation to your 2018 World Championship Regional Qualifier!
