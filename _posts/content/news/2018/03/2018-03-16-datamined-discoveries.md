### **16th March Update**

<br>

With another maintenance update comes new discoveries; **the identity of the 'superb' duelist, new cards and new skills** have been found courtesy of XOF and YAZAN!

### 'Superb' Téa Gardner

<br>

Téa will be the next ['superb'](/news/february-2018/in-game-updates/) roaming duelist with a deck upgrade, bringing with her a powerful Counter Trap Fairy deck! This event is expected to take place from March 22nd - 28th. 
 
These could be some of the drops to look forward to (RNG willing!): 

[deck](Meltiel, Sage of the Sky; Harvest Angel of Wisdom; Radiant Jeral; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Wingweaver; Guiding Light; Photon Booster; Constellar Belt; Tenderness; Divine Punishment)

### Top Player Council Thoughts

#### **[Superforms](/authors/superforms/)** says: 

- {Meltiel, Sage of the Sky} (UR): The core monster of Counter Fairies. Counter Traps are a tricky thing to slide into a deck in general because they can’t always deal with established threats (like a [REZ](/tier-list/red-eyes-zombies/), for example). Meltiel gives you extra ways to deal with things that don’t get directly destroyed by your Counter Traps. This is incredibly important because it gives you a way to mitigate the effects of going second. The LP gain is also not insignificant, giving you more fuel for {Seven Tools of the Bandit} and {Solemn Scolding}.
- {Divine Punishment} (SR): Negates a ton of stuff while the Field Spell ({The Sanctuary in the Sky}) is up. A very versatile negation card with no discard cost. Divine Punishment notably cannot stop already face-up backrow ({Sea Stealth Attack}, {Beast Rising}, {Call of the Archfiend}) nor can it stop normal summons (like Solemn Scolding can). 
- {Harvest Angel of Wisdom} (SR): Could see use in more defensive Counter Fairy decks that run less Counter Traps and take advantage of Harvest’s recycling effect.
- {Zeradias, Herald of Heaven} (SR): {Elemental HERO Captain Gold} for Counter Fairies. Searches the Field Spell ({The Sanctuary in the Sky}), adding consistency, and extra copies work as big beaters.
- {Radiant Jeral} (SR): Decent wall and boosts your LP if discarded for a Counter Trap cost with Sanctuary on the field, but pretty terrible relative to the other cards.
- {Photon Booster} (R): The first thing that comes to mind is the {Ra's Disciple} OTK deck, although there will likely be other uses.

Older cards that work well with these include {Bountiful Artemis} and {Cards from the Sky}. Also note that {The Sanctuary in the Sky} is an R reward from Ranked Duels, so that may be a worthwhile use for your R tickets this season.
 
On the deck as a whole:
- Counter Fairies can be incredibly strong when (1) they open well, (2) they go first, and (3) their opponent does not have access to big Normal Summoned monsters. Combo and effect reliant decks like [Hazy Flame](/tier-list/hazy-flame/) and [Sylvans](/tier-list/sylvans/) can struggle against Fairies, while [Dinos](/tier-list/dinos/) and [Fishes](/tier-list/fishes/) should dominate them with big 4-star monsters.
- As many of these cards do nothing without each other, {Duel, Standby!} or {Restart} seem necessary for consistency. Other skills like {Fairy’s Smile} or {Endless Trap Hell} will likely have issues with bricking.
 
Conclusion: This is an event worth farming; our first in a while! While Counter Fairies will almost certainly not be Tier 1, they have definite potential to impact the meta. All of Téa’s UR/SR drops are worth getting three copies of, except for {Radiant Jeral}.

### Miscellaneous Cards

[deck](Dragon's Mirror; Tethys, Goddess of Light; Confronting the "C"; Danipon; Super Solar Nutrient)

- {Dragon's Mirror} (UR) will likely only be playable through the datamined skill from [last month's update](/news/february-2018/datamined-discoveries/#structure-decks). 
- {Tethys, Goddess of Light} (SR) is likely an exclusive card for Téa's Lvl. 30/40 decks.
- {Super Solar Nutrient} (SR) could possibly be a new Card Trader addition given how much plant support has been released through it recently.

{Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus} and {Rare Value} were both upgraded in rarity from R to UR. Jesse Anderson will be the [next obtainable duelist](/news/february-2018/in-game-updates/) in late March, so it's likely these are either his drop or level up rewards! 

A possible new Card Trader feature has been found, 'premium' and 'shine' cards:

### New Skills

Skills have been found in the game files relating to {Amazoness Village}, {Gilford the Lightning} and {Sogen}. Konami is clearly getting into the April Fools' spirit by creating a skill that starts the duel with the 'Field Spell' {Blast Held by a Tribute} which is in fact Ishizu's signature Trap card!

### Deck Customization
A feature that had been requested by players since Duel Links' inception will soon be here! Players will finally be able to choose a sleeve and gamemat for **each and every deck** - no need to visit the Card Studio everytime you want a new look.

### Box Sale
To celebrate 65 million downloads there will be a 3 day sale, but the specifics are still a mystery.

And lastly a new icon, perhaps summon {Hungry Burger} 100 times? Who knows!

***Keep in mind that much of the datamined information is speculation, and remains unconfirmed until officially announced by Konami.***

### Miscellaneous Cards

[deck](Fossil Tusker; Gigantes)

These cards were also found in the datamine, however it is unknown what they are intended for, most likely NPC cards in the [DD Tower event](/events/march-2018/dd-tower-wind-and-earth-dimension/).

***Keep in mind that much of the datamined information is speculation, and remains unconfirmed until officially announced by Konami.***
