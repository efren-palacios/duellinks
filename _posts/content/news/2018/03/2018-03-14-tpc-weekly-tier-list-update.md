#### NOTES by Taaha:  
* REZ and Aliens stay in Tier 1. Clear dominance and tops in all tournaments.
* GB and SSA stay at tier 2. Few GB tops lately and constant water SSA results. Water SSA is still becoming more defined in its core as it proves itself as a top tier deck.
* Fly Fish has been getting many results lately including first place in All Day Invitational (7 round Swiss -> Single Elim tourney) and first place in last week's Meta Weekly.
* CA stays at Tier 3 due to significant weaknesses to the Tier 1 decks. Maybe Hey, Trunade can bring CA back to the top?
* Dinos are still a very powerful deck on paper and have favorable matchups against many of the top tier decks. Although not many representatives of this deck, they still have a solid place in the tier list.
* Magnets are demoted to Tier 3. The reasoning for this is that other than MiguelJoker, the deck has nearly no results in tournament. Statistics wise, the deck is the same as Dinos in results and thus it has been moved to Tier 3.
* Hazy and Snipe Hunter Control were reevaluated this week. Hazy has had no representatives in any tournaments since MCS where two players got top 32. TPC has concluded that the deck is still powerful (although with clear weaknesses) but needs more representation in tournaments to fully evaluate. With more players getting access to Swamp Mirrorer, the deck will improve. Snipe Hunter placed 2nd in Will Cup and thus is still in Tier 3 for now. 
* Destiny Heroes are proving to be a very powerful deck. However, their core is not defined and fully optimal decks are yet to surface. Because of this, two separate channels focusing on DHeroes were created. #dark-city-dheroes and #fusion-dheroes.
