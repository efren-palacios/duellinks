It has been revealed that Dr Vellian Crowler will be the newest addition to the gate, bringing with him Ancient Gear cards previously from the [event](/events/february-2018/dr-vellian-crowlers-tricky-tests/).

<br>

New skills relating to {The Winged Dragon of Ra} have been found! This may hint that the arrival of Marik Ishtar is not too far.

### Miscellaneous Cards

[deck](Fossil Tusker; Gigantes)

These cards were also found in the datamine, however it is unknown what they are intended for, most likely NPC cards in the [DD Tower event](/events/march-2018/dd-tower-wind-and-earth-dimension/).

***Keep in mind that much of the datamined information is speculation, and remains unconfirmed until officially announced by Konami.***
