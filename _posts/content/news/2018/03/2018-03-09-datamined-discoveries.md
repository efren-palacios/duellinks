### 16th March Update

<br>

With another maintenance update comes new discoveries; **the identity of the 'superb' duelist, new cards and new skills** have been found courtesy of XOF!

### 'Superb' Téa Gardner

<br>

![Banner](/img/content/news/2018/03/datamined-discoveries/banner-tea-event.png)

Téa will be the next roaming duelist with a deck upgrade, bringing with her a powerful counter trap Fairy deck! These could be some of the drops to look forward to (RNG willing!):

[deck](Meltiel, Sage of the Sky; Harvest Angel of Wisdom; Radiant Jeral; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Tethys, Goddess of Light; Wingweaver; Guiding Light; Photon Booster; Constellar Belt; Freya, Spirit of Victory; Tenderness)

### Miscellaneous Cards

[deck](Dragon's Mirror; Divine Punishment; Super Solar Nutrient; Confronting the "C"; Danipon)

- {Dragon's Mirror} will likely only be playable through the datamined skill from [last month's update](/news/february-2018/datamined-discoveries/#structure-decks). 
- {Divine Punishment} is likely to be an NPC only card in Téa's Lvl. 40 deck. 
- {Super Solar Nutrient} could possibly be a new Card Trader addition given how much plant support has been released through there recently.

{Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus} and {Rare Value} were both upgraded in rarity from R to UR. Jesse Anderson will be the next obtainable duelist in late March, so it's likely these are either his drop or level up rewards! 

There are also card 'shines' that has been found, however it is unclear at present what they're actually for.

### New Skills

<br>
<br>

New skills have been found in the game files. Konami is clearly getting into the April Fools' spirit by creating a skill that starts the duel with the 'Field Spell' {Blast Held by a Tribute} which is in fact Ishizu's signature trap card!

### Deck Customization
A feature that had been requested by players since Duel Links' inception will soon be here! Players will finally be able to choose a sleeve and gamemat for **each and every deck** - no need to visit the Card Studio everytime you want a new look.

### Box Sale
To celebrate 65 million downloads, Konami will be having a 3 day sale - the specifics are still a mystery!

And lastly a new icon, perhaps summon {Hungry Burger} 100 times? Who knows!

***Keep in mind that much of the datamined information is speculation, and remains unconfirmed until officially announced by Konami.***

<br>
<br>

New skills relating to {The Winged Dragon of Ra} have been found! This may hint that the arrival of Marik Ishtar is not too far.

### Miscellaneous Cards

[deck](Fossil Tusker; Gigantes)

These cards were also found in the datamine, however it is unknown what they are intended for, most likely NPC cards in the [DD Tower event](/events/march-2018/dd-tower-wind-and-earth-dimension/).

***Keep in mind that much of the datamined information is speculation, and remains unconfirmed until officially announced by Konami.***
