## April 26th Update

<br>

With another maintenance update comes new discoveries; **a new Mini Box, new cards, new events and new skills** have been found courtesy of XOF and YAZAN!

<a name="261"></a>

### Mini Box: Visions of Ice

The next Mini Box is expected to be released on **May 1st**, there will also be a sale. The following cards have been **confirmed** to be in the box:

[gallery](/img/content/news/2018/04/datamined-discoveries/26-mini-box.png, /img/content/news/2018/04/datamined-discoveries/26-box-sale.png, /img/content/news/2018/04/datamined-discoveries/26-mini-box-2.png)

<br>
<br>

[deck](White Night Dragon; The Tricky; Mage Power; Treacherous Trap Hole; Blizzard Princess; Spellbook Magician of Prophecy; Spellbook of Secrets; Spellbook of Life; Dragon Ice; Tribute Burial; Ice Master; Gusto Thunbolt; Reeze, Whirlwind of Gusto; Gusto Griffin; Spellbook of Power; Justice of Prophecy; Spellbook of Fate; Cold Enchanter; Caam, Serenity of Gusto; Windaar, Sage of Gusto; Contact with Gusto; Chain Dispel)

### First Impressions

#### [Superforms](/top-player-council/superforms/) says:

There are two new archetypes: Spellbooks (with Prophecy Monsters) and Gustos.

Thoughts on Spellbooks and Prophecy:
- {Strength of Prophecy} boosts itself easily.
- {Justice of Prophecy} searches but at the cost of losing a Normal Summon.
- {Spellbook of Fate}’s Banish effect is one of the few good Spellbook effects we have.
I don’t think Spellbooks will be a standalone deck with the Prophecy monsters. May find a home with Dark Magician or Endymion decks that use spell counters.

Thoughts on Gustos:
- Between {Psychokinesis} and {Contact with Gusto}, there’s a lot of spot removal.
- {Gusto Thunbolt} is a slow, unreliable floater and is not itself Psychic, but can grab {Reeze, Whirlwind of Gusto} to steal a Monster.
- {Gusto Griffin} is by far the best searcher, grabbing any Gusto monster from the Deck. Can combo with {Lady Ninja Yae}, {Dark World Dealings}, and {Snipe Hunter}.
- {Caam, Serenity of Gusto} generates some card advantage and is a decent Psychic beater (which we need for {Psychokinesis}).
- Seems to be some tension between the Winged Beast Gusto monsters and the Psychic support cards that you would want to use.
- Like Spellbooks, Gustos do not seem like a solid standalone deck and will instead have to mesh with older cards.

Other interesting cards:
- {The Tricky}: Most obvious synergy with Spellbooks and Treeborn, but has a lot of general utility. Instant access to {Beatdown} while tossing anything you like into the grave and still having your Normal Summon.
- {White Night Dragon}: A big Dragon with a nice effect, and has synergy with {Ruins of the Divine Dragon Lords}, which we now have at 2x (Mokuba Lvl: 45 Reward).
- {Treacherous Trap Hole}: Potential Main Deck material for both [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/) and [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/), likely at 1-2x. Both Decks run little to no Traps already, and both Decks can be okay with targeting their own Monsters for destruction if necessary (Sylvans don’t mind losing {Rose Lover} or {World Carrotweight Champion}, and Masked Heroes can {Mask Change} out of the target or just destroy a {Destiny HERO - Celestial} to set up a draw).
- {Tribute Burial}: Nice Dragon support, and good synergy with {Eclipse Wyvern}.

### New Skills

Many new {Jinzo} related skills have been unearthed pointing perhaps to an Espa Roba event/unlock in the future.

### Battle City Event

On May 3rd there will be an addition to the currently ongoing [Battle City Showdown](/events/april-2018/battle-city-showdown/) event. You will have to undertake "Divine Trials" to defeat the "Divine Duelist" (Yami Yugi) to unlock his new skill!

<br>
<br>

<a name="266"></a>

### Miscellaneous

A new item that spawns "Vagrants" which give 5 to 30 times more EXP than Standard Duelists has been found, perfect for the [recent character level cap increase](/news/april-2018/level-45-rewards/)! Also, a character profile for Tristan Taylor has been found as well as the "Popular Cards" filter for the Deck Editor which has been postponed.

## April 18th Update

<br>

Our resident dataminer, XOF, has found details of next month's Ranked Duels Reward tickets!

<a name="181"></a>
### New Ranked Tickets

[deck](Dodger Dragon; Big Burn; Cold Feet)

<a name="182"></a>
### [Top Player Council](/top-player-council/) Thoughts

<a name="182a"></a>
#### {Dodger Dragon} (SR Ticket)

**[Xanxus](/top-player-council/Xanxus/)** says:
- Trash!

**[》3K《 All Day](/top-player-council/3KAllDay/)** says:
- More of an Auto Duel Deck card then meta, so pretty bad.

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/SelectMaple/)** says:
- Can dodge {Ultimate Providence} and {Divine Wrath}, but this card takes away your Normal Summon. It's just another 1900 Dragon beater with a low graded effect. Cannot see this being good in competitive play.

**[Glading](/top-player-council/Glading/)** says:
- Try {Hey, Trunade!} instead?

**[BuilttoTilt](/top-player-council/BuilttoTilt/)** says:
- Very limited uses, it's an extremely niche card that likely won't see any competitive play.

---

<a name="182b"></a>
#### {Big Burn} (R Ticket)

**[Xanxus](/top-player-council/Xanxus/)** says:
- Trash, but maybe future potential as Side Deck card.

**[》3K《 All Day](/top-player-council/3KAllDay/)** says:
- Interesting card, shows potential. It may be a good Side Deck card. 

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/SelectMaple/)** says:
- I would use {Different Dimension Ground} or {Crevice Into The Different Dimension} over {Big Burn}.

**[Glading](/top-player-council/Glading/)** says:
- it is a good Side Deck card against [Archfiends](/tier-list/deck-types/archfiends/) right now and it has potential for future metas.

**[BuilttoTilt](/top-player-council/BuilttoTilt/)** says:
- This card is a nice Side Deck option against Graveyard oriented decks such as [Archfiends](/tier-list/deck-types/archfiends/) to counter cards like {Call of the Archfiend}. It has a niche over cards like {Foolish Return} and {Disappear}, as it banishes all monsters from the Graveyard making all other revival cards in the deck useless.

<a name="182c"></a>
#### {Cold Feet} (N Ticket)

**[Xanxus](/top-player-council/Xanxus/)** says:
- Trash, but nice artwork.

**[》3K《 All Day](/top-player-council/3KAllDay/)** says:
- OMEGALUL 🚮

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/SelectMaple/)** says:
- Trash!

**[Glading](/top-player-council/Glading/)** says:
- The perfect card for Guns to make a video.

**[BuilttoTilt](/top-player-council/BuilttoTilt/)** says:
- Pretty God damn useless!

## April 13th Update

### [Yami Marik Event](/news/april-2018/in-game-updates/#12) Leaks

An image from a Japanese magazine has been circulating online revealing that {Granadora} will be a new event drop.

<br>

Also, one of the skills that we revealed in last months [Datamined Discoveries article](/news/march-2018/datamined-discoveries/), 'Power of the Tributed' has been confirmed to be the new skill for Yami Marik!

## April 5th Update

<br>

With another maintenance update comes new discoveries; albeit a small datamine this time **new cards and a sale** has been found courtesy of the illustrious XOF! 

<a name="51"></a>
### New Cards

[deck](Spell Strider; Dr. Frankenderp; Intrigue Shield; That Wacky Alchemy!)

Thanks to Superforms's quick thinking we have details of the upcoming Duel-A-Thon event where the featured reward will be {Intrigue Shield}!

[slider](/img/content/news/2018/04/datamined-discoveries/slider-05-duel-a-thon.jpg)

<a name="52"></a>
### [Top Player Council](/top-player-council/) Thoughts

<a name="521"></a>
#### {Spell Strider} (UR)

**[Superforms](/top-player-council/superforms/)** says:
- This card is most relevant as a way to trade Field Spells (like {Straight to the Grave} [Red-Eyes Zombies](/tier-list/deck-types/red-eyes-zombies/) against {Mythic Depths} [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/). Not a ton of other use right now.

**[》3K《 All Day](/top-player-council/3KAllDay/)** says:
- Interesting card but too hard to utilize. Building a deck around {Big Bang Shot} still requires a second spell. This will likely be used for a Field Spell for Field Spell trade off and not that great.

**[Glading](/top-player-council/Glading/)** says:
- Maybe good against [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/) that you can banish your Field Spell and your opponent's {Umi}.

**[Xanxus](/top-player-council/Xanxus/)** says:
- At the moment very good against [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/) decks, but it only makes sense, if you play a 'Field Spell Skill' or other decks like Wallet Control, where you have good access to permanent spell cards. Mostly it's only a side deck option or most likely a tech. Perhaps this card has more potential in future (I can imagine this card in Crystal Beast decks, after they get more support).

**[Whybona](/top-player-council/whybona/)** says:
- Good against [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/) but irrelevant in the current meta outside of that, it's also situational for your own deck to be running face up spells.

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/Machdragon/)** says:
- A decent side deck alternative to counter Field Spell reliant decks like [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/) if you don't own {Cosmic Cyclone}.

**[MiguelJoker](/top-player-council/migueljoker/)** says:
- Great Side Deck card against [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/) decks.

---

<a name="522"></a>
#### {Intrigue Shield} (SR)

**[Superforms](/top-player-council/superforms/)** says:
- Only being available at 1x hurts this card's potential quite a bit, but it can potentially be used in annoying [Stall](/tier-list/stall-decks/)-type decks with {Duck Dummy} and/or {The Unhappy Girl}. 

**[》3K《 All Day](/top-player-council/3KAllDay/)** says:
- This card being 1x might be pretty good. A tech card like {Curse of Anubis} and {Windstorm of Etaqua}. You can slap this on key monsters you don't want destroyed but you'll still be open to {Enemy Controller} tribute-take and {Super Rush Headlong}.

**[Glading](/top-player-council/Glading/)** says:
- No PvP potential!

**[Xanxus](/top-player-council/Xanxus/)** says:
- This is a Normal Trap card playable with Paleozoics, but I do not see a high potential usage for this card.

**[Whybona](/top-player-council/whybona/)** says:
- May have some uses in gimmicky decks but likely won't see any competitive use due to the requirement of the monster having to be in Attack position.

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/Machdragon/)** says:
- I can see this being played in {The Unhappy Girl} farm decks. Generic once per turn battle protection is also quite good. It provides a nice boost to possible Amazoness decks.

**[MiguelJoker](/top-player-council/migueljoker/)** says:
- Really good card in some decks, for example, {Hieratic Dragon of Nuit} which Special Summons a Normal Dragon when targeted by a  Spell, Trap or card effect.
- It also works well with {Cocoon of Ultra Evolution}.

#### {That Wacky Alchemy!} (SR)

**[Superforms](/top-player-council/superforms/)** says:
- The card most likely to be relevant to top-tier decks. Alchemy works (in addition to other ways) after chains involving your opponent’s Spell cards resolve, meaning you can pop an {Cyber Angel Idaten} after it’s summoned off a non-protecting ritual spell ({Sprite's Blessing} or {Machine Angel Absolute Ritual}) or a {Masked HERO Anki} after it’s summoned off {Mask Change}. Because spells aren’t sent to the grave until after they resolve, you can’t chain to things like {Cosmic Cyclone} (when it’s targeting) or {Hey, Trunade!}. however, neither [Sylvans](/guides/deck-types/sylvans-guide-intro-by-superforms/) nor [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/) (the current [Tier 1](/tier-list/) decks) are particularly hurt by this card, so at present it seems like Side Deck potential at best.

**[》3K《 All Day](/top-player-council/3KAllDay/)** says:
- This card might be a hidden gem. {Enemy Controller}, {Super Rush Headlong}, {Mask Change} and many more - it's a good tradeoff. It will especially hurt [Cyber Angels](/guides/deck-types/the-cyber-angels-guide-by-negative1/) after a ritual spell. Probably won't have any effect on [Sylvans](/guides/deck-types/sylvans-guide-intro-by-superforms/) or [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/).

**[Glading](/top-player-council/Glading/)** says:
- You can use this card when you opponent activates a Normal Spell and it's sent to the graveyard but it's still not flexible even in this case.

**[Xanxus](/top-player-council/Xanxus/)** says: 
- Nice Side Deck option. I would be amazing if this would work with traps too. Actually, it's a nice card to interrupt Ritual plays (without protection) or against Masked Heroes (an easy +1), but in other top tier matchups it's not that effective.

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/Machdragon/)** says:
- Pretty good card, provides much needed 1 for 1 Monster removal for the game and can be activated after the resolution of an opponent’s spell card. Many powerful spell cards such as {Enemy Controller} exist in the current meta so this may see play in Side Decks.

**[MiguelJoker](/top-player-council/migueljoker/)** says:
- It's a card with potential. If we get any Tier 1 decks like Masked Heroes that use {Mask Change} you'll be able to destroy a Monster on the field which ain't bad. But as I said for this card to be in the Main Deck we need Destiny Heroes Mask Change to be a Top Tier deck, but perhaps it's a solid choice for a Side Deck card.

<a name="524"></a>
#### {Dr. Frankenderp} (R)

**[Superforms](/top-player-council/superforms/)** says:
- Bad. It wouldn’t fit into any Psychic decks, and those fell off the [Tier List](/tier-list/) a long time ago.

**[》3K《 All Day](/top-player-council/3KAllDay/)** says:
- Trash!

**[Glading](/top-player-council/Glading/)** says:
- No PvP potential.

**[Xanxus](/top-player-council/Xanxus/)** says:
- Not good at the moment but it maybe has future potential with more support cards.

**[Whybona](/top-player-council/whybona/)** says:
- Another garbage Psychic Monster to go alongside the mass of useless Psychic Monsters which have been released since {Serene Psychic Witch}.

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/Machdragon/)** says:
- This card isn’t great since it uses up your Normal Summon and skips your Draw Phase to activate its effect. Does not have a place in competitive play.

**[MiguelJoker](/top-player-council/migueljoker/)** says:
- Maybe future potential in OTK decks or Burn decks.
