## April 5th Update

<br>

With another maintenance update comes new discoveries; albeit a small datamine this time **new cards and a sale** has been found courtesy of the illustrious XOF! 

### New Cards

[deck](Spell Strider; Dr. Frankenderp; Intrigue Shield; That Wacky Alchemy!)

Thanks to Superforms's quick thinking we have details of the upcoming Duel-A-Thon event where the featured reward will be {Intrigue Shield}!

### [Top Player Council](/top-player-council/) Thoughts

#### {Spell Strider} (UR)

**[Superforms](/authors/superforms/)** says:
- This card is most relevant as a way to trade Field Spells (like {Straight to the Grave} [Red-Eyes Zombie](/guides/deck-types/red-eyes-zombies-guide-by-insano/) against {Mythic Depths} [Sea Stealth Attack](/guides/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack-guide-by-builttotilt/)). Not a ton of other use right now.

**[》3K《 All Day](/authors/3KAllDay/)** says:
- Interesting card but too hard to utilize. Building a deck around {Big Bang Shot} still requires a second spell. This will likely be used for a Field Spell for Field Spell trade off and not that great.

**[Glading](/authors/Glading/)** says:
- Maybe good against [Sea Stealth Attack](/guides/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack-guide-by-builttotilt/) that you can banish your Field Spell and your opponent's {Umi}.

**[Xanxus](/authors/Xanxus/)** says:
- At the moment very good against [Sea Stealth Attack](/guides/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack-guide-by-builttotilt/) decks, but it only makes sense, if you play a 'Field Spell Skill' or other decks like Wallet Control, where you have good access to permanent spell cards. Mostly it's only a side deck option or most likely a tech. Perhaps this card has more potential in future (I can imagine this card in Crystal Beast decks, after they get more support).

**Whybona** says:
- Good against [Sea Stealth Attack](/guides/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack-guide-by-builttotilt/) but irrelevant in the current meta outside of that, it's also situational for your own deck to be running face up spells.

**[Machdragon](/authors/Machdragon/)** says:
- A decent side deck alternative to counter Field Spell reliant decks like [Sea Stealth Attack](/guides/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack-guide-by-builttotilt/) if you don't own {Cosmic Cyclone}.

**MiguelJoker** says:
- Great Side Deck card against [Sea Stealth Attack](/guides/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack-guide-by-builttotilt/) decks.

#### {Intrigue Shield} (SR)

**[Superforms](/authors/superforms/)** says:
- Only being available at 1x hurts this card's potential quite a bit, but it can potentially be used in annoying [Stall](/tier-list/stall-decks/)-type decks with {Duck Dummy} and/or {The Unhappy Girl}. 

**[》3K《 All Day](/authors/3KAllDay/)** says:
- This card being 1x might be pretty good. A tech card like {Curse of Anubis} and {Windstorm of Etaqua}. You can slap this on key monsters you don't want destroyed but you'll still be open to {Enemy Controller} tribute-take and {Super Rush Headlong}.

**[Glading](/authors/Glading/)** says:
- No PvP potential!

**[Xanxus](/authors/Xanxus/)** says:
- This is a Normal Trap card playable with Paleozoics, but I do not see a high potential usage for this card.

**Whybona** says:
- May have some uses in gimmicky decks but likely won't see any competitive use due to the requirement of the monster having to be in Attack position.

**[Machdragon](/authors/Machdragon/)** says:
- I can see this being played in {The Unhappy Girl} farm decks. Generic once per turn battle protection is also quite good. It provides a nice boost to possible Amazoness decks.

**MiguelJoker** says:
- Really good card in some decks, for example, {Hieratic Dragon of Nuit} which Special Summons a Normal Dragon when targeted by a  Spell, Trap or card effect.

#### {That Wacky Alchemy!} (SR)

**[Superforms](/authors/superforms/)** says:
- The card most likely to be relevant to top-tier decks. Alchemy works (in addition to other ways) after chains involving your opponent’s Spell cards resolve, meaning you can pop an {Cyber Angel Idaten} after it’s summoned off a non-protecting ritual spell ({Sprite's Blessing} or {Machine Angel Absolute Ritual}) or a {Masked HERO Anki} after it’s summoned off {Mask Change}. Because spells aren’t sent to the grave until after they resolve, you can’t chain to things like {Cosmic Cyclone} (when it’s targeting) or {Hey, Trunade!}. however, neither [Sylvans](/guides/deck-types/sylvans-guide-intro-by-superforms/) nor [Sea Stealth Attack](/guides/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack-guide-by-builttotilt/) (the current [Tier 1](/tier-list/) decks) are particularly hurt by this card, so at present it seems like Side Deck potential at best.

**[》3K《 All Day](/authors/3KAllDay/)** says:
- This card might be a hidden gem. {Enemy Controller}, {Super Rush Headlong}, {Mask Change} and many more - it's a good tradeoff. It will especially hurt [Cyber Angels](/guides/deck-types/the-cyber-angels-guide-by-negative1/) after a ritual spell. Probably won't have any effect on [Sylvans](/guides/deck-types/sylvans-guide-intro-by-superforms/) or [Sea Stealth Attack](/guides/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack-guide-by-builttotilt/).

**[Glading](/authors/Glading/)** says:
- You can use this card when you opponent activates a Normal Spell and it's sent to the graveyard but it's still not flexible even in this case.

**[Xanxus](/authors/Xanxus/)** says: 
- Nice Side Deck option. I would be amazing if this would work with traps too. Actually, it's a nice card to interrupt Ritual plays (without protection) or against Masked Heroes (an easy +1), but in other top tier matchups it's not that effective.

**[Machdragon](/authors/Machdragon/)** says:
- Pretty good card, provides much needed 1 for 1 Monster removal for the game and can be activated after the resolution of an opponent’s spell card. Many powerful spell cards such as {Enemy Controller} exist in the current meta so this may see play in Side Decks.

#### {Dr. Frankenderp} (R)

**[Superforms](/authors/superforms/)** says:
- Bad. It wouldn’t fit into any [Psychic] decks, and those fell off the [Tier List](/tier-list/) a long time ago.

**[》3K《 All Day](/authors/3KAllDay/)** says:
- Trash!

**[Glading](/authors/Glading/)** says:
- No PvP potential.

**[Xanxus](/authors/Xanxus/)** says:
- Not good at the moment but it maybe has future potential with more support cards.

**Whybona** says:
- Another garbage Psychic Monster to go alongside the mass of useless Psychic Monsters which have been released since {Serene Psychic Witch}.

**[Machdragon](/authors/Machdragon/)** says:
- This card isn’t great since it uses up your Normal Summon and skips your Draw Phase to activate its effect. Does not have a place in competitive play.

**MiguelJoker** says:
- Maybe future potential in OTK decks or Burn decks.
