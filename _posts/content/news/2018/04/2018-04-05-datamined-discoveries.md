## April 5th Update

With another maintenance update comes new discoveries; albeit a small datamine this time **new cards and a sale** has been found courtesy of the illustrious XOF! 

### New Cards

### KC Cup Celebration Sale

Will they be bringing back the ultimate 3 cards + 1 UR for $0.99 - let's keep our fingers crossed!

*Keep in mind that much of the datamined information is speculation, and remains unconfirmed until officially announced by Konami.*
