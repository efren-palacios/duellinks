### Top Player Council Thoughts

#### [Superforms](/top-player-council/superforms/)

<br>

##### Trash:

- {Tackle Crusader} (Yugi Muto)
- {Ancient Gear Box} (Crowler)
- {Jirai Gumo} (Paradox Brothers)
- {Newdoria} (Marik)

<br>

##### Came Too Late:  

- {Blue Flame Swordsman} (Joey):  
Would have been nice months ago, irrelevant now. Probably best with Six Samurais (with {Hand of the Six Samurai} and {Great Shogun Shien}), and it doesn’t seem that great there.  

- {Gravekeeper's Visionary} (Ishizu):  
A nice boss monster but will do very little for GK in the current meta. Really doesn't help that he can't be searched by {Gravekeeper's Recruiter}.  

- {Toon Gemini Elf} (Pegasus):  
An instant addition to Toon decks, but does not bring Toon decks out of irrelevancy.  

<br>

##### YouTube:

- {Proton Blast} (Keith):  
YouTube fun.  

- {Ojamassimilation} (Chazz):  
Banishes Ojama monsters in exchange for Fusion materials. Pure YouTube.  

- {King of the Skull Servants} (Bonz):  
Now available at 3x. This is just a fun YouTube deck.  

- {Overtex Qoatlus} (Rex):  
Apparently relevant in the TCG, it seems like it lacks the support to have any impact in Duel Links right now. It has obvious synergy with {Survival Instinct} and {Tyranno Infinity}, and may make a good YouTube deck.  

<br>

##### Future Potential:  

- {Miraculous Descent} (Téa):  
Combos nicely with {Cards from the Sky} but lacks good targets.  

- Quantum Cat (Odion):  
Just {Swamp Mirrorer} with different stats, and useless in Hazy thanks to 0 ATK. Future potential with new summoning mechanics.  

- {Carboneddon} (Bastion):  
A free vanilla Red-Eyes summon. Maybe future potential.  

- {The Melody of Awakening Dragon} (Kaiba):  
Searches Blue-Eyes monsters, {Dark Horus}, {Rainbow Dragon}, and {Armed Dragon LV10}. Lack of good targets makes this keeps this at “future potential”.   

<br>

##### Support for Non-Meta Decks:  

- {Howling Insect} (Weevil):  
Nice little buff for Insect Queen decks as it floats into {Pinch Hopper}/{Resonance Insect}.  

- {Crystal Bond} (Jesse):  
The best Crystal Beast card we have right now, but likely not good enough to make the archetype relevant.  

- {Aegis of the Ocean Dragon Lord}(Mako):   
A nice protection card in Paleozoics, and can be used to trigger the Paleo effects (even when you have none on the field).  

- {Swing of Memories} (Alexis):  
Now at 2x, a card with definite future potential that was used in the past with Gemini monsters. Does not seem to have a great place in a top-tier deck right now.  

##### Support for Potential Top-Tier Decks:  

- {Skilled Dark Magician} (Arkana):  
A second copy allows {Dark Magician} decks to start filling out their monster line-up without {Sergeant Electro}, which has been badly needed for a while. Works well with {Skilled Blue Magician} (currently a drop in the [Battle City](/events/april-2018/battle-city-showdown/) event).  

- {Dark Magic Inheritance} (Yami Yugi):  
May possibly work well with Spellbooks (coming in the next minibox) and can search for {Dark Magic Curtain} (or {Thousand Knives}/{Dark Magic Attack} if Curtain was already searched by {Magician's Rod}).  

- {Dark Ruler Ha Des} (Bakura):  
A very appreciated second copy, and a nice buff to [Treeborn Tribute](/guides/deck-types/treeborn-guide-by-xb8/) decks.  

- {Destiny HERO - Plasma} (Aster):  
A second copy, and still an amazing card. Struggles to deal with {Enemy Controller}, but has insane lockdown potential if protected. {Forbidden Chalice} being common will likely hold this card back.  

- {Ruins of the Divine Dragon Lords} (Mokuba):  
A second copy of a great card. {Paladin of Felgrand} + Ruins = any Dragon from your Deck, and would be a nice way to turbo out {White Night Dragon} (coming in the next minibox).  

- {Card Trooper} (Jaden):  
A 1900 beater after milling 3, and gives you a free draw when destroyed. Graveyard-fueled decks like [Archfiends](/tier-list/deck-types/archfiends/) will test this card, comparing it to {Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress}.  

##### Will be Used in a Top-Tier Deck:

- {Amazoness Queen} (Mai):  
Incredible card with the available Amazoness support. Summon {Amazoness Princess} (coming with Elegant Mai), search {Amazoness Onslaught}, attack with Princess to summon Queen. If Queen was already in your hand, just wait until you can summon it with the Onslaught you just searched.  

<br>

##### First 3 Cards I will Pursue:   
- {Amazoness Queen} (Mai)
- {Card Trooper} (Jaden)  
- {Ruins of the Divine Dragon Lords} (Mokuba Kaiba) 
 
<br>

<br>

##### Will be Used in a Top-Tier Deck:  

- {Card Trooper} (Jaden)

<br>

##### Might be Used in a Top-Tier Deck:  

- None at the moment

<br>

##### Future Potential:  

- {The Melody of Awakening Dragon} (Kaiba)  
- {Amazoness Queen} (Mai)  
- {Dark Ruler Ha Des} (Yami Bakura)  

<br>

##### First 3 Cards I will Pursue:

- {Amazoness Queen} (Mai)  
- {Destiny HERO - Plasma} (Aster)
