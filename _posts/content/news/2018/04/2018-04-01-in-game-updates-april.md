### [Awaken! Rainbow Dragon!](/events/march-2018/awaken-rainbow-dragon/) Survey

Konami actively reads player feedback so fill in the event survey to voice any woes. If you felt there weren't enough UR/SR drops, drops weren't evenly distributed or perhaps lack of Gems got you feeling down - put it into words! You can also use the survey to write non-event feedback.
