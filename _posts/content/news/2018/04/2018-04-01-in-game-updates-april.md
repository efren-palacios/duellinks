You are able to change your country/region only **once** so if it's incorrect be sure to do it.

## April 4th (Update 4)

### [Awaken! Rainbow Dragon!](/events/march-2018/awaken-rainbow-dragon/) Survey

Konami actively reads player feedback so fill in the event survey to voice any woes. If you felt there weren't enough UR/SR drops, drops weren't evenly distributed or perhaps lack of Gems got you feeling down - put it into words! You can also use the survey to write non-event feedback.

### Maintenance Notice

There will be a maintenance tomorrow to conclude the [Jesse event](/events/march-2018/awaken-rainbow-dragon/) from 05:00 to 08:30 (GMT+1) - no Duel Links for over three hours! :'(

### KC Cup

1st Stage of the KC Cup is starting on Thursday 5th April. Those who reached [King of Games last season](/top-decks/march-2018/) will automatically be entered into the 2nd Stage - rank highly for bragging rights, Prismatic cards and an invitation to your 2018 World Championship Regional Qualifier.
