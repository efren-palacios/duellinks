## 18th April Update

<br>

The Card Trader's inventory has been updated with some new additions to his card pool! 

[deck](Spell Strider; Token Thanksgiving; Dr. Frankenderp)

### Top Player Council Thoughts

<a name="18a"></a>
#### {Spell Strider}

**{#Superforms}** says:

> This card is most relevant as a way to trade Field Spells (like {Straight to the Grave} [Red-Eyes Zombies](/guides/deck-types/red-eyes-zombies-guide-by-insano/) against {Mythic Depths} [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/). Not a ton of other use right now.

**{#3K All Day}** says:

> Interesting card but too hard to utilize. Building a deck around {Big Bang Shot} still requires a second spell. This will likely be used for a Field Spell for Field Spell trade off and not that great.

**{#Glading}** says:

> Maybe good against [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/) that you can banish your Field Spell and your opponent's {Umi}.

**{#Xanxus}** says:

> At the moment very good against [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/) decks, but it only makes sense, if you play a 'Field Spell Skill' or other decks like Wallet Control, where you have good access to permanent spell cards. Mostly it's only a side deck option or most likely a tech. Perhaps this card has more potential in future (I can imagine this card in Crystal Beast decks, after they get more support).

**{#Whybona}** says:

> Good against [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/) but irrelevant in the current meta outside of that, it's also situational for your own deck to be running face up spells.

**{#Machdragon}** says:

> A decent side deck alternative to counter Field Spell reliant decks like [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/) if you don't own {Cosmic Cyclone}.

**{#MiguelJoker}** says:

> Great Side Deck card against [Sea Stealth Attack](/tier-list/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack/) decks.

**{#Superforms}** says:

> Trash!

#### {Dr. Frankenderp}

**{#Superforms}** says:

> Bad. It wouldn’t fit into any Psychic decks, and those fell off the [Tier List](/tier-list/) a long time ago.

**{#3K All Day}** says:

> Trash!

**{#Glading}** says:

> No PvP potential.

**{#Xanxus}** says:

> Not good at the moment but it maybe has future potential with more support cards.

**{#Whybona}** says:

> Another garbage Psychic Monster to go alongside the mass of useless Psychic Monsters which have been released since {Serene Psychic Witch}.

**{#Machdragon}** says:

> This card isn’t great since it uses up your Normal Summon and skips your Draw Phase to activate its effect. Does not have a place in competitive play.

**{#MiguelJoker}** says:

> Maybe future potential in OTK decks or Burn decks.

### Required Items
- {Spell Strider}: 100,000 Gold, 4 UR Jewel, 80 Stone of Earth
- {Token Thanksgiving}: 16,000 Gold, 35 R Jewel, 40 Stone of Spell
- {Dr. Frankenderp}: 17,000 Gold, 35 R Jewel, 35 Stone of Darkness
