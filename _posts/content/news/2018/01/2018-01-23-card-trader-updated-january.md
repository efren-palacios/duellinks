The Card Trader's inventory has been updated with some new additions to his card pool.

[deck](That Grass Looks Greener; Aromage Bergamot; Vivid Knight)

### Top Player Council Opinions

**{#Superforms} says:** 

> {Vivid Knight} only really has synergy with Bujins at the moment, and I don't think they'd run him.

> {Aromage Bergamot} has potential in future Plant decks because it seems like a really nice semi-boss monster in a consistent, swarming Plant deck with other 1-tribute monsters (so that {Soul Exchange} could be used), which we don't have yet. 

> {That Grass Looks Greener}* is a very interesting card that's actually limited in the TCG despite the fact that we're getting it with the same consistency (60-card TCG decks ran 3x {That Grass Looks Greener} + 3x Searchers for it; we can just do 3x Grass in a 30-card deck).
Grass fuels graveyard combos but likely requires you to play 25-30 cards, which means that your deck needs to be able to run without it. Obvious candidates include Red-Eyes Zombies and Magnets, but so is anything that special summons based on graveyard conditions - think {Pyrorex the Elemental Lord}, {Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Evening Twilight}, {Spell Striker}, {Darkflare Dragon}, {Dark Necrofear}, etc. 
In the TCG, {That Grass Looks Greener} was abused with the "Infernoid" archetype which is full of those kind of monsters and consistent even without {That Grass Looks Greener}. Anything similar to this that makes its way to Duel Links should have a lot of synergy with it.

**[Kazin_X](/authors/kazin_x/)  says:** 

> {That Grass Looks Greener}'s implication is too far reaching, probably useful for many archetypes in the future... Currently though, it can be good for {Red-Eyes Slash Dragon} to fill the graveyard with things like {Dawn Knight}, {Destiny HERO - Dasher}, {Destiny HERO - Malicious}, {A/D Changer}, {Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Evening Twilight}, and much more. Exodia can probably do some stupid stuff like use {That Grass Looks Greener} to mill, and then use {Backup Soldier}. Plants can benefit from it too, by dumping {Rose Lover} and doing a very quick swarm. I guess Zombies, especially Red-Eyes Zombies can benefit, but I don't want to mention things {#superforms} already mentioned.

**[Tutpup](/authors/tutpup/) says:** 

> {Vivid Knight} is not very impressive. Could see play if Bujins become meta, but even then I don't think most Bujin decks are going to want to waste a normal summon on this card.

> {Aromage Bergamot}: The current plant decks we have doesn't really synergize with "LP Gain", so I don't think this card is going to see play. Maybe in some YouTube decks, but at first glance without looking into specific cards in the game that might synergize with it, I would say this is not going to see any real play.

> The exact impact *{That Grass Looks Greener}* is going to have is hard to predict. We have already seen people like Billy Brake play {Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress} in his Red-Eyes Zombie deck and have great results with it. I think {That Grass Looks Greener} is going to advance decks that play with the graveyard to the next level, i.e. {Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Evening Twilight} decks, {Red-Eyes Slash Dragon} decks, Bujin Decks, etc.

### Summary

{Aromage Bergamot} and {Vivid Knight} don't seem to have any immediate impact on any top-tier decks. They might see play in future archetypes yet to be released.

{That Grass Looks Greener} is very exciting, mostly for decks we will eventually see in the future, but also for certain top-tier competitive decks right now. It may see play in Red-Eyes Zombies and Red-Eyes Slash Dragon. It may also push decks like Bujins, Plants, graveyard banishers and others to competitive status.

### How to unlock

The Card Trader is unlocked at Stage 7 and the cards in stock change periodically.
