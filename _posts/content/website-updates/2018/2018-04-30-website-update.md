### The following changes have been made to the website

#### New features

- A new [Skills](/farming/skills/) page has been implemented that allows you to search and filter for skills, similar to the Top Decks page.
- A search feature has been added to the main navigation menu. This searchbox lets you find articles and pages throughout the whole website based on matches on title and description.
- Content editors now have the option to include a "Back to Top" button on long articles.

#### Updates / changes

- All article and page link thumbnails have been redesigned.
- All references to player profiles are now highlighted with their respective discord role colors. 
- Added player roles on profile pages.
- A "How to Obtain" section has been added to all the skill hover popups. 
- On deck type introduction pages, the list of latest top decks has been expanded past the current month, if needed (i.e. May, April, March, etc.)  
- Improved the user experience of image galleries (smoother drag / slide).
- The size of the counter icon on the playtester has been adjusted for smaller screens.

#### Bugfixes

- There was an issue with the playtester where the leftmost card would get stuck and not able to be dragged. This has been resolved.
- A little while ago, we implemented a feature-banner which content editors could turn on and off and would link to an article of their choice. This banner was not displaying properly on safari. The display of this banner has been adjusted to work on safari.
- There were issues with hoverable cards when the card name was also a skill name (i.e. Destiny Draw). This has now been fixed.
- Pages where an image gallery was included would be very laggy to scroll. This has been fixed.

#### Comments from the devs

**{#Creative}**

> There has been quite some time between this update and our previous one. This because we aimed to deliver a quality update to prepare the website for the upcoming release. The redesign of the article thumbnails was one of the major tasks to complete for this. We also worked on some important internal performance improvements which would help us out in the long run. That being said, I hope you guys are as hyped as us for the upcoming release. This time it's for real!

Please let us know below if you find any website related issues. We appreciate your feedback and highly value your input.
