### Farm Decks

<a name="jadehex"></a>

#### Level 40 Cloudian Farm - created by Jadehex

[deck:Draw Sense: WATER](Summoner of Illusions; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Cloudian - Turbulence; Anti-Magic Arrows; Union Attack; Union Attack; The Sanctuary in the Sky; The Sanctuary in the Sky; The Sanctuary in the Sky; Dimensionhole; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping)
[deck](Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon; Master of Oz)    

**Strategy**
- You win if you have {Cloudian - Turbulence} + {The Sanctuary in the Sky}/{Spirit Barrier} combo!
- If you don't have Cloudian - Turbulence in your opening hand take 1500 damage so you can activate your skill and draw it
- Use {Zeradias, Herald of Heaven} to search for the Field Spell
- Use {Good Goblin Housekeeping} to draw into {Summoner of Illusions} and {Dimensionhole} - you'll need them **before** the last turn so **don't** return them to the bottom of the deck! 
- Set Summoner of Illusions second to last turn and activate Dimensionhole banishing it (so it doesn't get destroyed)

**Last Turn** 
You should only have {Cloudian - Turbulence} and a facedown {Summoner of Illusions} in your Monster zones

- Flip summon Summoner of Illusions and tribute Cloudian - Turbulence to special summon {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon}/{Master of Oz}
- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
- Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} and swing for victory!

**Replacements**
- {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by "Drawing" in the Card Editor), for example, {Shard of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc. However, if you replace Good Goblin Housekeeping you'll need to add {Pot of Benevolence} to avoid drawing {Summoner of Illusions} or {Dimensionhole} last

**Risks**
- There is a small risk that he'll burn you with {Bowganian} but he'll most likely tribute for {Masked Beast Des Gardius} before that happens.
- If your LP is low enough he will activate {Mask of the Accursed} but otherwise he won't use it on {Cloudian - Turbulence}

#### Level 40 Ra Farm for **Marik & Arkana** - created by Charlie Mckiz

[deck:Destiny Draw](The Winged Dragon of Ra; Kiseitai; Kiseitai; Kiseitai; Cosmic Compass; Anti-Magic Arrows; Arrivalrivals; Draining Shield; Draining Shield; Draining Shield; Jar of Greed; Damage Vaccine Ω MAX; Damage Vaccine Ω MAX; Damage Vaccine Ω MAX; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Enchanted Javelin; Enchanted Javelin; Enchanted Javelin)

**Strategy**

- Stall and gain LP while taking minimal damage from your opponent's Monsters

**Last Turn** 

1. Summon {Cosmic Compass} with 3 Tokens 
2. Enter the Battle Phase, activate {Arrivalrivals} to Summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra} then chain {Anti-Magic Arrows}
3. Activate the effect of {The Winged Dragon of Ra} when prompted and attack into the lowest ATK Attack position Monster
	
**Replacements**

- You can replace {Arrivalrivals} with {Double Summon}
- You can replace the skill with {Duel, standby!}, {Restart} etc. 

**Notes**  
- For Arkana Lvl. 40 you don't need {Anti-Magic Arrows}, use {Jar of Greed} instead
- There are several replacement card options (standard Ra pretty much works)

[deck](Ojama Knight; Ojama Knight; Ojama Knight)

**Strategy**

- Summon {Ojama Knight} as soon as possible to lockdown at least one of Marik's Monster zones
- After that, use {Ojama Blue} and {King of the Swamp} to keep thinning your deck

2. Activate {Ojama Country}
3. Switch both {Ojama Knight} into Attack position
4. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}

[deck](Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon)   

**Strategy**
- Lock down Jesse's monsters with {The Unhappy Girl} 
- Only summon two The Unhappy Girl as you need one free zone for {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Attack his monsters with The Unhappy Girl to "lock" them down so they can't attack (you take no battle damage with {Holy Guard})
- Before the last turn, ensure {Temple of the Kings} is on the field and tribute summon {Mystical Beast of Serket} - tribute both to special summon {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon}
- Use your draw cards to finish the Duel quicker

**Last Turn**
You should only have one {The Unhappy Girl} and Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon in your Monster zones

- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
- Enter Battle Phase and swing for victory!

**Replacements**
- {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Shard of Greed} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by "Drawing" in the Card Editor), for example, {Jar of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc. However, if you replace Good Goblin Housekeeping you'll need to add {Pot of Benevolence} to avoid drawing {Temple of the Kings} or {Mystical Beast of Serket} last
- {Crystal Seer} can be replaced by {Skelengel}, {Dekoichi the Battlechanted Locomotive}, {Dark Mimic LV1} etc
