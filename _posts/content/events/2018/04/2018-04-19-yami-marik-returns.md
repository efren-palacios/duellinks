### Update

- Don't forget to fill out the [event survey](/news/april-2018/in-game-updates/) - let Konami know what's on your mind!

![](/img/content/events/2018/04/yami-marik-returns/marik-lvl-50.png)

Yami Marik Lvl. 50 will now spawn in Duel World (DM) with a [stronger deck](#50) in tow! If you've collected at least 1,000,000 Event points and completed the other five challenges you'll be able to Duel him to obtain the almighty protector of the sun and sky, {The Winged Dragon of Ra} (or if you already obtained it last event, you get {Mega Ultra Chicken}) and the new skill {Power of the Tributed}!
  
#### Strategies

There's no need to farm Yami Marik Lvl. 50 since his rewards are identical to Lvl. 40. However, here are some tips to defeat him easily.
 
On Yami Marik's turn he'll tribute {The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode} on his field to Special Summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra}. If you have a Monster on the field he will activate Ra's effect to destroy it by paying 1000 LP, so don't Summon anything if you go first. Instead use cards that will allows you to stall for a turn like {Windstorm of Etaqua}, {Curse of Anubis}, {Impenetrable Attack}, {Massivemorph}, {Draining Shield}, {Defense Draw} etc.    

- Monster destruction cards will enable you to get rid of Ra (not Sphere Mode since it can't be targeted by effects), you can then proceed to defeat Yami Marik pretty easily, for example: 
    - {Tribute to the Doomed}   
    - {Divine Wrath}
    - {Parallel Twister}
    - {Order to Charge}
    - {Michizure}
- Activate {Murmur of the Forest} targeting Ra, it will be changed to face-down Defense Position and will have 0 ATK/DEF! 
- Summon {Cyber Angel Dakini} and activate her effect to send Ra or Sphere Mode to the Graveyard 
- Activate {Enemy Controller} on your 2nd/3rd turn to tribute your Monster and take control of Ra, then activate its effect to destroy Yami Marik's other Monster and attack him directly for game
- Activate {Soul Exchange} to tribute Ra for a Level 5/6 Monster - works well with a Hazy Flame Deck
- You can banish Ra with {Black Dragon Ninja} 

- Use {Massivemorph} on Ra to stall by preventing it attacking you directly then attack Ra with {Amazoness Swords Woman} to deal 6500 LP damage to Yami Marik whilst also fulfilling the last mission below!

**New event missions have also been added - get up to 125 Gems!**

### Farm Decks

<a name="jadehex"></a>

#### Lvl. 40 **(Marik)** Cloudian Farm - created by Jadehex

[deck:Draw Sense: WATER](Summoner of Illusions; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Cloudian - Turbulence; Anti-Magic Arrows; Union Attack; Union Attack; The Sanctuary in the Sky; The Sanctuary in the Sky; The Sanctuary in the Sky; Dimensionhole; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping)
[deck](Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon; Master of Oz)    

##### Strategy
- You win if you have {Cloudian - Turbulence} + {The Sanctuary in the Sky}/{Spirit Barrier} combo!
- If you don't have Cloudian - Turbulence in your opening hand take 1500 damage so you can activate your skill and draw it
- Use {Zeradias, Herald of Heaven} to search for the Field Spell
- Use {Good Goblin Housekeeping} to draw into {Summoner of Illusions} and {Dimensionhole} - you'll need them **before** the last turn so **don't** return them to the bottom of the deck! 
- Set Summoner of Illusions second to last turn and activate Dimensionhole banishing it (so it doesn't get destroyed)

##### Last Turn  
You should only have {Cloudian - Turbulence} and a facedown {Summoner of Illusions} in your Monster zones

- Flip summon Summoner of Illusions and tribute Cloudian - Turbulence to special summon {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon}/{Master of Oz}
- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
- Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} and attack directly for victory!

##### Replacements
- You can substitute {Summoner of Illusions} + {Dimensionhole} + {Spirit Barrier} for {Polymerization} + {Gate Guardian} + {UFOroid} and put {UFOroid Fighter} in the Extra Deck
- {Good Goblin Housekeeping} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by "Drawing" in the Card Editor), for example, {Jar of Greed}, {Shard of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc. However, if you replace Good Goblin Housekeeping you'll need to add {Pot of Benevolence} to avoid drawing {Summoner of Illusions} or {Dimensionhole} last

##### Risks
- There is a small risk that he'll burn you with {Bowganian} but he'll most likely tribute for {Masked Beast Des Gardius} before that happens.
- If your LP is low enough he will activate {Mask of the Accursed} but otherwise he won't use it on {Cloudian - Turbulence}

---

<a name="charlie"></a>

#### Lvl. 40 **(Marik & Arkana)** Ra Farm - created by Charlie Mckiz

[deck:Destiny Draw](The Winged Dragon of Ra; Kiseitai; Kiseitai; Kiseitai; Cosmic Compass; Anti-Magic Arrows; Arrivalrivals; Draining Shield; Draining Shield; Draining Shield; Jar of Greed; Damage Vaccine Ω MAX; Damage Vaccine Ω MAX; Damage Vaccine Ω MAX; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Enchanted Javelin; Enchanted Javelin; Enchanted Javelin)

##### Strategy
- Stall and gain LP while taking minimal damage from your opponent's Monsters

##### Last Turn 
1. Summon {Cosmic Compass} with 3 Tokens 
2. Enter the Battle Phase, activate {Arrivalrivals} to Summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra} then chain {Anti-Magic Arrows}
3. Activate the effect of {The Winged Dragon of Ra} when prompted and attack into the lowest ATK Attack position Monster
	
##### Replacements
- You can replace {Arrivalrivals} with {Double Summon}
- You can replace the skill with {Duel, standby!}, {Restart} etc 

##### Notes  
- For Arkana Lvl. 40 you don't need {Anti-Magic Arrows}, use {Jar of Greed} instead
- There are several replacement card options (standard Ra pretty much works)  

---

<a name="superforms"></a>

#### Lvl. 40 **(Marik)** Hazy Farm - created by Superforms

[deck:Aroma Strategy](Dynatherium; Dynatherium; Hazy Flame Sphynx; Hazy Flame Sphynx; Hazy Flame Sphynx; Hazy Flame Cerbereus; Hazy Flame Cerbereus; Hazy Flame Cerbereus; Soul Exchange; Soul Exchange; Soul Exchange; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Swamp Mirrorer; Swamp Mirrorer; Swamp Mirrorer; Beast Rising; Beast Rising; Beast Rising)

##### Strategy
- Only keep one Monster on the field so you don't get {Lava Golem}'d
- Keep on destroying Marik's Monsters each turn
- When you activate {Swamp Mirrorer} declare Beast/Beast-Warrior and any Attribute
- Boost your Hazy Flame Monster to 10,000 ATK using {Beast Rising}
- Go for game when you have three or less cards left in you Deck so you can clear any {Powerful Rebirth}

##### Last Turn 
- Summon a Monster by the effect of {Hazy Flame Sphynx} or activate {Swamp Mirrorer}
- Attack Marik with you non-boosted Monster first to clear the field/bait {Powerful Rebirth}

##### Replacements
- {Dynatherium} is optimal but it can be replaced for {Earth Armor Ninja}, or {Flame Tiger} which is much worse however
- {Soul Exchange} can be replaced for {Mausoleum of the Emperor} as he can't target any of your Hazy Flame monsters with his burn cards so there's no risk of losing due to them

<a name="tutpup"></a>

#### Lvl. 40 **(Marik)** Ojama Farm - created by [Tutpup](https://www.twitch.tv/tutpup) 

[deck:Duel, standby!](King of the Swamp; King of the Swamp; Ojama Blue; Ojama Blue; Ojama Blue; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Ojama Black; Ojama Black; Ojama Yellow; Ojama Yellow; Ojama Green; Ojama Green; Anti-Magic Arrows; Union Attack; Union Attack; Polymerization; Polymerization; Polymerization; Ojama Country; Secret Pass to the Treasures)
[deck](Ojama Knight; Ojama Knight; Ojama Knight)

##### Strategy

- Summon {Ojama Knight} as soon as possible to lockdown at least one of Marik's Monster zones
- After that, use {Ojama Blue} and {King of the Swamp} to keep thinning your deck
- **Do not** summon another Monster as Marik may tribute them both with {Lava Golem} 

##### Last Turn 
1. Summon a second {Ojama Knight}
2. Activate {Ojama Country}
3. Switch both {Ojama Knight} into Attack position
4. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} 
5. Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
6. Attack directly for victory!
	
##### Replacements
* {King of the Swamp} can be replaced for {Fusion Recycling Plant}, {Fusion Sage} etc 
* {Ojama Country} can be replaced by {Shield & Sword}
* {Ojama Blue} can be replaced by {Painful Decision}
* If you only have one {Union Attack} you replace the second with {Spell Reclamation}
* Alternatively, you can use the skills {Restart} or {Balance}

<a name="elstar"></a>

#### Lvl. 40 **(Marik)** Unhappy Girl Farm - created by [elStar](https://www.twitch.tv/elstar)

Here is a cheap and **consistent** build to farm Marik Lvl. 40. I prefer {Duel, standby!} over {Holy Guard} because using {Spirit Barrier} protects against him attempting to OTK as well as if you want to crash your {Rai-Mei} to thin out your deck. Note that he will not Summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra} with this build.

[deck:Duel, standby!](Gravekeeper's Vassal; The Unhappy Girl; The Unhappy Girl; The Unhappy Girl; Rai-Mei; Rai-Mei; Rai-Mei; Anti-Magic Arrows; Union Attack; Union Attack; Enemy Controller; Legacy of Yata-Garasu; Legacy of Yata-Garasu; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Massivemorph)

##### Strategy
- Summon {The Unhappy Girl} as soon as possible!
- Marik will not attack The Unhappy Girl at all unless he can OTK, this gives you time to draw {Spirit Barrier} 
- Once you draw Spirit Barrier the farm is straightforward, don't use The Unhappy Girl to lock his Monsters as Marik may activate {Nightmare Wheel}
- Only summon **two** The Unhappy Girl as you need one free zone for {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Use your draw cards to get your combo and finish the Duel quicker

##### Last Turn  
You should only have two {The Unhappy Girl} in your Monster zones

- Activate {Massivemorph} and target {Masked Beast Des Gardius}, then activate {Enemy Controller} tributing an {The Unhappy Girl}
- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Target Vassal with two {Union Attack}
- Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows}, and attack into his weakest monster for victory!

##### Replacements
- {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by "Drawing" in the Card Editor), for example, {Jar of Greed}, {Shard of Greed} etc

##### Notes
- If Marik summons {Bowganian}, he will most likely use it as a tribute for {Masked Beast Des Gardius}, though you may lose some LP it won't be lethal

---

<a name="grandmaster"></a>

#### Lvl. 40 **(Marik)** Backup Squad Farm - created by Grandmaster

[deck:Restart](Gravekeeper's Vassal; Caligo Claw Crow; Anti-Magic Arrows; Union Attack; Union Attack; Enemy Controller; Backup Squad; Backup Squad; Backup Squad; Temple of the Mind's Eye; Temple of the Mind's Eye; Temple of the Mind's Eye; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Draining Shield; Draining Shield; Draining Shield; Curse of Anubis; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Massivemorph)

##### Strategy
 - Use {Restart} if you don't have {Backup Squad} in your hand, activate it if you do
 - That will buy you a couple turns as Marik will not attack unless he has lethal in that Battle Phase
 - You can use a {Draining Shield} before activating {Temple of the Mind's Eye} to avoid getting burned by {Bowganian} however most time he will tribute Bowganian to Special Summon {Masked Beast Des Gardius}
 - If you don't have Draining Shield set, activate Temple
 - With Temple and {Backup Squad} activated whilst your LP is 3000 or higher Marik will **100%** not attack you
 - But once you have 3 cards left in your deck he will **then** attack you in attempt to deck you out
 - Ensure you have {Massivemorph} set, he will always attack with Masked Beast Des Gardius last. 
 - Let the first 2 Monsters attack you (you will draw 2 cards by the effect of {Backup Squad}), then activate Massivemorph and target Masked Beast Des Gardius and that will leave you with one card in your Deck

##### Last Turn
- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Special Summon {Caligo Claw Crow}, then activate {Enemy Controller} tributing it for Masked Beast Des Gardius   
- Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
- Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows}, and attack directly with Vassal for victory!

##### Replacements
- {Caligo Claw Crow} can be replaced for {The Fiend Megacyber}
- {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by "Drawing" in the Card Editor), for example, {Jar of Greed}, {Shard of Greed}, {Good Goblin Housekeeping} etc 

---

<a name="jadehex2"></a>

#### Lvl. 40 **(Marik)** Labby Farm - created by Jadehex

[deck:Labyrinth Builder](Anteatereatingant; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Planet Pathfinder; Planet Pathfinder; Planet Pathfinder; Anti-Magic Arrows; Sorcerous Spell Wall; Sorcerous Spell Wall; Union Attack; Union Attack; Shield & Sword; Abyssal Designator; Abyssal Designator; Abyssal Designator; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Legacy of Yata-Garasu; Legacy of Yata-Garasu; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed)

##### Strategy
- Activate your skill to play {Labyrinth Wall} only after you activate {Sorcerous Spell Wall} (use {Planet Pathfinder} to search for it), so it's safe from {Masked Beast Des Gardius}
- Declare 'Divine' + 'Divine Beast' with {Abyssal Designator}
    - The first Abyssal Designator has a 50% chance to hit {The Winged Dragon of Ra}
    - The second one will certainly get it and send it to the Graveyard
- Use your draw cards and Planet Pathfinder to finish the Duel quicker, sometimes you may need to crash a Pathfinder (it will have 1300 ATK with {Sorcerous Spell Wall}) into {Bowganian} to survive, so keep one on hand

##### Last Turn
1. Activate {Shield & Sword}
2. Switch {Labyrinth Wall} into Attack position
3. Special Summon {Anteatereatingant} by sending any two non-essential Spells/Traps to the Graveyard (I usually choose an {Abyssal Designator}, {Sorcerous Spell Wall} or {Legacy of Yata-Garasu}/{Jar of Greed}) but be sure to keep a Sorcerous Spell Wall active
4. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
5. Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
6. Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} and attack directly for victory!

##### Replacements
- {Anteatereatingant} can be replaced for {The Fiend Megacyber}
- {Sorcerous Spell Wall} can be replaced by {Acidic Downpour}, however if you do substitute it's better to use [Hi_Im_Flabber's Farm Deck](#flabber) below
- {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by 'Drawing' in the Card Editor), for example, {Shard of Greed}, {Good Goblin Housekeeping} etc

---

<a name="flabber"></a>

#### Lvl. 40 **(Marik)** Labby Farm - created by Hi_Im_Flabber

In comparison to the {Labyrinth Builder} build above, this Deck still allows you to attain 9999+ Damage even if Marik Summons two {Dark Jeroid}.

[deck:Labyrinth Builder](Summoner of Illusions; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Planet Pathfinder; Planet Pathfinder; Planet Pathfinder; Anti-Magic Arrows; Sorcerous Spell Wall; Sorcerous Spell Wall; Union Attack; Union Attack; Abyssal Designator; Abyssal Designator; Abyssal Designator; Dimensionhole; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping)
[deck](Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon; Master of Oz) 

##### Strategy
- Activate your skill to play {Labyrinth Wall} only after you activate {Sorcerous Spell Wall} (use {Planet Pathfinder} to search for it), so it's safe from {Masked Beast Des Gardius}
- Declare 'Divine' + 'Divine Beast' with {Abyssal Designator}
    - The first Abyssal Designator has a 50% chance to hit {The Winged Dragon of Ra}
    - The second one will certainly get it and send it to the Graveyard
- Use your draw cards and Planet Pathfinder to finish the Duel quicker, sometimes you may need to crash a Pathfinder (it will have 1300 ATK with {Sorcerous Spell Wall}) into {Bowganian} to survive, so keep one on hand
  
On the *second to last* turn, set {Summoner of Illusions} and activate {Dimensionhole} banishing it.

##### Last Turn 
1. Flip up {Summoner of Illusions}, tributing {Labyrinth Wall}, to Special Summon {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon} or {Master of Oz}
2. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} 
3. Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
4. Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} and attack directly for victory!

##### Replacements
- {Sorcerous Spell Wall} can be replaced by {Acidic Downpour}
- {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by "Drawing" in the Card Editor), for example, {Shard of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc. However, if you replace Good Goblin Housekeeping you'll need to add a {Pot of Benevolence} to avoid drawing {Summoner of Illusions} or {Dimensionhole} last
