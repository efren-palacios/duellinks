### [Top Player Council](/top-player-council/) Thoughts

**[Superforms](/authors/superforms/)** says:
- As {Intrigue Shield} is only available at 1x this hurts its potential quite a bit, but it can potentially be used in annoying [Stall](/tier-list/stall-decks/)-type decks with {Duck Dummy} and/or {The Unhappy Girl}. 

**[》3K《 All Day](/authors/3KAllDay/)** says:
- This card being 1x might be pretty good. A tech card like {Curse of Anubis} and {Windstorm of Etaqua}. You can slap this on key monsters you don't want destroyed but you'll still be open to {Enemy Controller} tribute-take and {Super Rush Headlong}.

**[Glading](/authors/Glading/)** says:
- No PvP potential!

**[Xanxus](/authors/Xanxus/)** says:
- This is a Normal Trap card playable with Paleozoics, but I do not see a high potential usage for this card.

**Whybona** says:
- May have some uses in gimmicky decks but likely won't see any competitive use due to the requirement of the Monster having to be in Attack position.

**[Machdragon](/authors/Machdragon/)** says:
- I can see this being played in {The Unhappy Girl} farm decks. Generic once per turn battle protection is also quite good. It provides a nice boost to possible Amazoness decks.

**MiguelJoker** says:
- Really good card in some decks, for example, {Hieratic Dragon of Nuit} which Special Summons a Normal Dragon when targeted by a  Spell, Trap or card effect.
- It also works well with {Cocoon of Ultra Evolution}.
