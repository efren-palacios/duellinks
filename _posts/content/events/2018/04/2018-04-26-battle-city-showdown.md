### Update

The Treasure Room has appeared, land on it to enter the room to get tons of Millenium Coins and Duel the Battle City commissioner - [Mokuba](#mokuba-kaiba)! 

**However, instead of defeating Mokuba you can farm him for 375 EXP each Duel by losing (at either Lvl. 20 or Lvl. 40) with a bad Deck, you can also Auto-Duel to speed things up. It only cost 1 Dice Fragment per Duel in the Treasure Room so 20 Dice Fragments from winning a Ranked Duel equates to 7500 EXP!**

### First Impressions

#### [Superforms](/top-player-council/superforms/) says:

- {Skilled Blue Magician}: More support for Spell Counters and works well with {Skilled Dark Magician}. If Spellbooks are good (coming in the next Mini Box), they may be used in a {Dark Magician} or {Endymion, the Master Magician} Deck along with this card.
- {Dark Sage}: Trash!
- {Fusion Sword Murasame Blade}: While Equip Spells are generally not worthwhile, the ATK boost combined with protection is nice. Probably one of the best equips in the game, but likely still won’t see play since the top Warrior Deck ([Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/)) doesn’t have any place for it.

### Legendary Duelist Duels

Completing each mission rewards you with 15 Millenium Coins and a win at Lvl. 40 nets you an additional 150 Coins.

- However, the Skill is nullified if {Dark Necrofear} leaves his Graveyard.
