![](/img/content/events/2018/04/battle-city-showdown/event-bonus.jpg)

#### May 3rd

Use your "Divine Offerings" to challenge Yami Yugi Lvl: 50 in a "Divine Trial" and obtain his new skill {Card of Sanctity} as well as 100 Gems!  

[slider](/img/content/events/2018/04/battle-city-showdown/slider-update.jpg)

There's no need to farm him since all he drops are more "Divine Offerings", but here's his Decklist anyway.

[deck:Divine Advent](Valkyrion the Magna Warrior; King of the Swamp; Legion the Fiend Jester; Kuriboh; Buster Blader; Berfomet; King's Knight; Dark Magician; Dark Magician; Gamma the Magnet Warrior; Alpha the Magnet Warrior; Beta the Magnet Warrior; Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts; Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts; Jack's Knight; Queen's Knight; Fusion Recycling Plant; Polymerization; Emblem of Dragon Destroyer; Emblem of Dragon Destroyer)
[deck](Arcana Knight Joker; Dark Paladin; Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast)

#### April 29th

The Treasure Room has appeared, land on it to enter the room to get tons of Millenium Coins and Duel the Battle City commissioner - [Mokuba](#mokuba-kaiba)! 

![](/img/content/events/2018/04/battle-city-showdown/news-treasure-room.jpg)

**However, instead of defeating Mokuba you can farm him for 250 EXP each Duel by losing (at either Lvl: 20 or Lvl: 40) with a bad Deck, you can also Auto-Duel to speed things up. It only cost 1 Dice Fragment per Duel in the Treasure Room so 20 Dice Fragments from winning a Ranked Duel equates to 5000 EXP!**

[slider](/img/content/events/2018/04/battle-city-showdown/slider.jpg)

- Similar to the previous Battle City event, the "Treasure Room" will appear form April 29th onwards which rewards you with tons of Millennium Coins!
- It is speculated that Yami Yugi will get the new Skill {Card of Sanctity} after May 3rd!

<br>

### First Impressions

#### [Superforms](/top-player-council/superforms/) says:

> {Skilled Blue Magician}: More support for Spell Counters and works well with {Skilled Dark Magician}. If Spellbooks are good (coming in the next Mini Box), they may be used in a {Dark Magician} or {Endymion, the Master Magician} Deck along with this card.

> {Dark Sage}: Trash!

> {Fusion Sword Murasame Blade}: While Equip Spells are generally not worthwhile, the ATK boost combined with protection is nice. Probably one of the best equips in the game, but likely still won’t see play since the top Warrior Deck ([Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/)) doesn’t have any place for it.

### Legendary Duelist Duels

Completing each mission rewards you with 15 Millenium Coins and a win at Lvl: 40 nets you an additional 150 Coins.
