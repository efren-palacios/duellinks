### Farm Decks

***Level 40 Farm - created by Superforms***
> **7,700 Base DA (Duel Assessment)**

[deck:Duel, Standby!](Saffira, Queen of Dragons; Saffira, Queen of Dragons; Saffira, Queen of Dragons; Cyber Angel Dakini; Cyber Angel Idaten; Cyber Angel Benten; Cyber Angel Benten; Cyber Angel Benten; Senju of the Thousand Hands; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Cyber Petit Angel; Anti-Magic Arrows; Union Attack; Union Attack; Hymn of Light; Hymn of Light; Machine Angel Ritual; Sprite's Blessing; Sprite's Blessing; Secret Pass to the Treasures)

**Strategy**
-  Summon either {Saffira, Queen of Dragons} or {Cyber Angel Dakini} as soon as possible by using {Hymn of Light} or {Machine Angel Ritual}. Once these spells are in the grave, you are protected from Espa's {Tribute to the Doomed}
- If {Sprite's Blessing} was used to summon {Saffira, Queen of Dragons}, use her 'Draw 2 cards, then discard 1 card' effect and discard a {Machine Angel Ritual} or {Hymn of Light} if you have one in your hand
- Use {Cyber Angel Idaten} as a tribute for a ritual summon to boost your ritual monsters, otherwise you are susceptible to a {Jinzo} equipped with {Gravity Blaster}
- A common combo is to ritual summon {Cyber Angel Idaten} using {Cyber Angel Benten}, who's effects will then allow you to search a ritual monster ({Saffira, Queen of Dragons} is the best option) and a ritual spell ({Hymn of Light})
- Get 2 ritual monsters on the field before the last turn

**Last Turn** 
- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Use {Secret Pass to the Treasures} and double {Union Attack} on him
- Enter the Battle Phase and activate {Anti-Magic Arrows}
- Attack directly for victory!


**Replacements**
- {Senju of the Thousand Hands} can be replaced with another {Cyber Petit Angel}
- 1 copy of {Saffira, Queen of Dragons} can be replaced with another {Hymn of Light}, {Sprite's Blessing} or {Senju of the Thousand Hands}
- The optimal skills are {Duel, Standby!} and {Restart}, but the deck can be run without a skill

-  Use your machine destruction cards to stall Espa until the final turn 

**Last Turn** 
- On the *second to last* turn, set {Summoner of Illusions}
- On the last turn, flip up {Summoner of Illusions} to summon {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon} or {Master of Oz}
- Summon {Piranha Army}
- Use {Gift of the Martyr} and tribute your fusion monster. Give the ATK to {Piranha Army}

- Get 2 copies of {Dark Paladin} out by the end turn
- Use {Mooyan Curry} to heal Roba to get the 'Comeback Victory' bonus

- {King of the Swamp} and {Fusion Recycling Plant} can also be replaced with any searcher/substitute for {Polymerization}: {Fusion Gate}, {Fusion Sage} or {Elemental HERO Blazeman}
- A second {Dark Paladin} can be changed for {Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman}, however you must now include some Dragon-type monster cards in your farm deck
- 2 copies of {Buster Blader} can be switched our for {Emblem of Dragon Destroyer} to increase draw speed
- Overall the farm is extremely flexible, and most cards can be interchanged for other fusion support
