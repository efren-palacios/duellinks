### Event Information & Tips
- This is a brand new type of event whereby you duel against decks created by other Duelists all over the world!
- This event lasts from February 27th to March 9th.
- Before you choose to Duel/Auto-Duel you get a sneak peak of 1 card in your opponents deck so you have a vague idea what you're going up against.
- Save your Stamina Potions until the last couple of days to maximize the number of coins you receive.
- Always look for opponents who are worth of 6000+ points (7000 is the maximum). Keep refreshing as dueling a low point opponent is a waste of stamina. However, even if you lose the duel, you'll still get 3000+ points from the duel.
- Play a Ranked Duel each day to get 1 Stamina Potion!

### Lottery Rewards
The following cards can be drawn from the lottery in addition to Gems, Gold and coloured Keys:

[deck](Phantom Beast Rock-Lizard; Phantom Beast Cross-Wing; Phantom Beast Wild-Horn; Golden Homunculus; Dark Crusader; Gamushara; Chain Destruction; Saber Beetle; 7 Colored Fish; Pyramid Energy; United Front; The Statue of Easter Island; Space Mambo; Dokurorider; Revival of Dokurorider; Terrorking Salmon) 

### Top Player Council Review
[Superforms](/authors/superforms/): 'Competitively the cards are pretty much trash across the board unfortunately. More {Chain Destruction} doesn't really help mill (I've tried it already), and the rest of the cards are bad.'

### Event Rewards
You can obtain rewards based on the amount of Event Points you accumulate.

If you reach **one million points** you'll get **410 Gems**, **147,800 Gold**, **2 UR Stone**, **4 SR Stone**, **91 R Jewel** and **2 Stamina Potion** in total!
