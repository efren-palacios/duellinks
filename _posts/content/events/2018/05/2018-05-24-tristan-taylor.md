### Farm Decks

<a name="atlas"></a>

#### Lvl: 30/40 Gate Guardian Farm - credit: Ï†Atlas2052Ï†
[deck:Elements Unite!](Thunder Dragon; Thunder Dragon; Thunder Dragon; Winged Kuriboh; Winged Kuriboh; Winged Kuriboh; Gravekeeper's Vassal; The Flute of Summoning Kuriboh; The Flute of Summoning Kuriboh; The Flute of Summoning Kuriboh; Union Attack; Union Attack; Union Attack; Cards from the Sky; Cards from the Sky; Cards from the Sky; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping)   

##### Strategy
- Special summon {Gate Guardian}.
- Don't attack at all!
- Use your draw cards to finish the Duel quicker and use {Good Goblin Housekeeping} to return {Winged Kuriboh} or {Thunder Dragon} back to the deck to search them again. 
- **Note:** Don't use {Cards from the Sky} if you'll end up with 0 cards in deck after the effect since you won't be able to conduct your battle phase.

##### Last Turn 
1. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}. 
2. Target Vassal with your three {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}.
3. Enter battle phase and swing for victory!

##### Replacements
- You can replace one {Union Attack} with {Axe of Despair} (or {Battleguard Rage} after you win 3 duels) to ensure he can't attack over {Gate Guardian} or {Caligo Claw Crow}, {Blustering Winds} so you can get over 9,999+ ATK. 
- {Winged Kuriboh} + {The Flute of Summoning Kuriboh} + {Cards from the Sky} combo can be replaced for {Gravekeeper's Recruiter} + {Wonder Wand} and 3 other draw cards.
- {Good Goblin Housekeeping} is optimal but it can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by "Drawing" in the Card Editor) such as {Shard of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu}, {Jar of Greed} etc. 

##### Risk
- The only way Tristan can ruin the farm is a 4/5 card combo which is unlikely however if you have {Axe of Despair}/{Battleguard Rage} equipped you'll be 100% safe!

##### Strategy
- Stall and gain LP while taking minimal damage from your opponent's monsters.
- Allow {Kiseitai} to be attacked so you can start gaining LP each turn.
- Chain {Massivemorph} to {Draining Shield}/{Enchanted Javelin} to gain a big LP boost!

##### Last Turn 
1. Summon {Cosmic Compass} and activate its effect to special summon 2 tokens.
2. Enter the Battle Phase, activate {Arrivalrivals} to summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra} **then chain** {Anti-Magic Arrows}.
3. Activate the effect of The Winged Dragon of Ra when prompted and attack into the Token for victory!
	
##### Replacements

- You can replace the skill with {Destiny Draw} or {Restart}.

##### Notes  
- There are several replacement card options since there are many variations of a Ra farm deck.

#### Lvl: 40 Ra-Sylvans Farm

##### Strategy
- Swarm the field with monsters, using the effects of {Sylvan Komushroomo} and {Sylvan Marshalleaf} to destroy your opponents field.
- Keep on attacking Tristan's monsters, while excavating each turn. 

##### Tips
- Activate the effect of {World Carrotweight Champion} in the graveyard to send {Rose Lover} from your hand to graveyard.
- When Rose Lover is in the graveyard you can activate its effect to special summon {Sylvan Guardioak}/{Sylvan Hermitree}.
- Be wary not to activate the effect of {Sylvan Marshalleaf} if Tristan has no monsters on the field.

##### Last Turn
You should have at least one monster on the field.
1. Special summon {Sylvan Hermitree}/{Sylvan Guardioak} by the effect of {Rose Lover} (and {World Carrotweight Champion} if you only have two monsters on the field).  
2. Attack and destroy any monsters on the field then activate {Arrivalrivals} to tribute summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra}.
3. Activate Ra's effect when prompted to pay your life points to increase its ATK and to obtain the ["LP on Brink"](/farming/duel-assessment-score/) bonus.
4. Attack Jesse's life points directly!

#### Lvl: 40 Ra Farm - credit: [Freeska](/authors/freeska/)
[deck:Restart](The Winged Dragon of Ra; A Cat of Ill Omen; A Cat of Ill Omen; Skelengel; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird; Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird; Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird; White Magician Pikeru; White Magician Pikeru; Anti-Magic Arrows; Magic Planter; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Astral Barrier; Astral Barrier; Astral Barrier)

##### Strategy
- Get both {Spirit Barrier} and {Astral Barrier} on the field as soon as possible.
- Summon {Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird} and {White Magician Pikeru} to gain life points.
- Dodge Jesse's attacks with your "Barrier" combo.

##### Last Turn
Make sure you have three monsters on the field before the last turn.
1. Tribute summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra} using your three monsters.
2. Activate Ra's effect when prompted to pay your life points to increase its attack and to obtain the ["LP on Brink"](/farming/duel-assessment-score/) bonus.
3. Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} and attack the attack postion monster with the lowest ATK!

##### Replacements
- {Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird} and {White Magician Pikeru} can be replaced by {Cure Mermaid}.
- {Magic Planter} can be replaced with any generic card that lets you draw.
- A good option instead of {Crystal Seer} or {Skelengel} is {Defense Draw}.

##### Risks
- Not getting the "Barrier" combo out quick enough is deadly.
- If you're not careful with how you use your draw power, you won't have 3 monsters on the field by the last turn and won't be able to Tribute summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra}.

##### Notes
- Any variation of the "Ra deck" may work, for example, {Kiseitai} + {Massivemorph}, {Golden Ladybug} etc.
