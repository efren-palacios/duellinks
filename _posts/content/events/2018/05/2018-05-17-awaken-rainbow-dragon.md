### Top Player Council Thoughts

<a name="q1"></a>

#### "Do the new Crystal Beast cards and skill have the potential to produce a new top-tier deck?"

<br>

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- Probably not.

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- Probably not, but it would definitely be a fun deck to play though.

**[Whybona](/top-player-council/whybona/)** says:
- Currently I don't believe they do. The new cards and skill will make the deck extremely consistent with a fast engine but the deck is still extremely lacking enough power to compete in the current meta with a lack of a clear playstyle and win condition.

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- Yes!

<a name="q2"></a>

#### "Will any of the new Crystal Beast cards be used in a current top-tier deck?"

<br>

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- Unfortunately, no.

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- Nope!

**[Whybona](/top-player-council/whybona/)** says:
- I highly doubt it.

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- Not separately, but together yes. {Rare Value} gives the archetype the engine it needed.

<a name="q3"></a>

#### "Will you personally be farming this event?"

<br>

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- For 3 of every card, yes.

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- Yes, for the gems.

**[Whybona](/top-player-council/whybona/)** says:
- Only if Jesse is easy to farm.

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- Yes, I am.

### Farm Decks

<a name="jadehex"></a>

#### Level 40 Ra Farm - credit: [Jadehex](/authors/jadehex)
[deck:Duel, standby!](The Winged Dragon of Ra; Kiseitai; Kiseitai; Kiseitai; Cosmic Compass; Anti-Magic Arrows; Arrivalrivals; Supremacy Berry; Draining Shield; Draining Shield; Draining Shield; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Enchanted Javelin; Enchanted Javelin; Enchanted Javelin)

##### Strategy
- Stall and gain LP while taking minimal damage from your opponent's monsters.
- Allow {Kiseitai} to be attacked so you can start gaining LP each turn.
- Chain {Massivemorph} to {Draining Shield}/{Enchanted Javelin} to gain a big LP boost!

##### Last Turn 
1. Summon {Cosmic Compass} and activate its effect to special summon 2 Tokens in Attack position.
2. Enter the Battle Phase, activate {Arrivalrivals} to summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra} **then chain** {Anti-Magic Arrows}.
3. Activate the effect of The Winged Dragon of Ra when prompted and attack into the Token for victory!
	
##### Replacements
- You can replace {Arrivalrivals} with {Double summon}.
- You can replace the skill with {Destiny Draw} or {Restart}.

##### Notes  
- There are several replacement card options since there are many variations of a Ra farm deck.

#### Lvl: 40 Ra-Sylvans Farm - credit: lvmatterhorn
[deck:Power of the Tributed](The Winged Dragon of Ra; Sylvan Komushroomo; Sylvan Komushroomo; Sylvan Komushroomo; Rose Lover; Rose Lover; Rose Lover; Sylvan Hermitree; Sylvan Hermitree; Sylvan Hermitree; World Carrotweight Champion; World Carrotweight Champion; Sylvan Marshalleaf; Sylvan Marshalleaf; Sylvan Marshalleaf; Sylvan Guardioak; Sylvan Guardioak; Sylvan Guardioak; Fire Formation - Gyokkou; Arrivalrivals)

##### Strategy
- Swarm the field with monsters, using the effects of {Sylvan Komushroomo} and {Sylvan Marshalleaf} to destroy your opponents field.
- Keep on attacking Jesse's monsters, while excavating each turn.
- None of his monsters can get over {Sylvan Guardioak}/{Sylvan Hermitree} unless equipped with {Crystal Release} (2600 ATK {Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus}, 2800 ATK {Crystal Beast Topaz Tiger}), and even with it equipped you can still beat over them with Hermitree. 
- Try to keep two of his backrow clogged with Crystal Beasts so that his only possible play to ruin your farm is to activate {Rare Value} and draw into two {Crystal Release}, so only activate {Sylvan Komushroomo} to destroy his Crystal Release.

##### Tips
- Activate the effect of {World Carrotweight Champion} in the graveyard to send {Rose Lover} from your hand to graveyard.
- When Rose Lover is in the graveyard you can activate its effect to special {Sylvan Guardioak}/{Sylvan Hermitree}.
- Be wary not to activate the effect of {Sylvan Marshalleaf} if Jesse has no monsters on the field.

##### Last Turn
You should have at least one monster on the field.
1. Special summon {Sylvan Hermitree}/{Sylvan Guardioak} by the effect of {Rose Lover} (and {World Carrotweight Champion} if you only have two monsters on the field).  
2. Activate {Fire Formation - Gyokkou} to pin Jesse's set {Crystal Conclave} (he may have already activated it earlier in the duel).
3. Attack and destroy any monsters on the field then activate {Arrivalrivals} to tribute summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra}.
4. Activate Ra's effect when prompted to pay your life points to increase its ATK and to obtain the ["LP on Brink"](/farming/duel-assessment-score/) bonus.
5. Attack Jesse's life points directly!

##### Replacements
- Since Jesse may activate {Crystal Conclave} early on therefore rendering {Fire Formation - Gyokkou} useless it can be replaced with {World Carrotweight Champion}/{Amarylease}/{Naturia Pineapple} to help get out {Sylvan Guardioak} more consistently.

#### Lvl: 40 Ra Farm - credit: [Freeska](/authors/freeska/)
[deck:Restart](The Winged Dragon of Ra; A Cat of Ill Omen; A Cat of Ill Omen; Skelengel; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird; Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird; Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird; White Magician Pikeru; White Magician Pikeru; Anti-Magic Arrows; Magic Planter; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Astral Barrier; Astral Barrier; Astral Barrier)

##### Strategy
- Get both {Spirit Barrier} and {Astral Barrier} on the field as soon as possible.
- Summon {Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird} and {White Magician Pikeru} to gain life points.
- Dodge Jesse's attacks with your "Barrier" combo.
- **Tip:** To save time, quickly tap/un-tap "Auto Duel" during Jesse's Battle Phase so you don't have to activate {Astral Barrier} on each attack declaration.

##### Last Turn
Make sure you have three monsters on the field before the last turn.
1. Tribute summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra} using your three monsters.
2. Activate Ra's effect when prompted to pay your life points to increase its attack and to obtain the ["LP on Brink"](/farming/duel-assessment-score/) bonus.
3. Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} and attack the attack postion monster with the lowest ATK!

##### Replacements
- {Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird} and {White Magician Pikeru} can be replaced by {Cure Mermaid}.
- {Magic Planter} can be replaced with any generic card that lets you draw.
- A good option instead of {Crystal Seer} or {Skelengel} is {Defense Draw}.

##### Risks
- Not getting the "Barrier" combo out quick enough is deadly.
- If you're not careful with how you use your draw power, you won't have 3 monsters on the field by the last turn and won't be able to Tribute summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra}.

##### Notes
- Any variation of the "Ra deck" may work, for example, {Kiseitai} + {Massivemorph}, {Golden Ladybug} etc.

##### Strategy
- Keep on drawing cards and gaining LP with {Aromage Jasmine} + {Aroma Garden} combo.
- Summon {Aromage Rosemary} and destroy Jesse's monsters each turn.
- Be aware that the effects of Aromage Jasmine and Aromage Rosemary are compulsory. 

##### Last Turn
You should have at least two monsters on the field.
1. If you don't have a third monster on the field, summon one.
2. If Jesse has a monster, attack and destroy it with {Aromage Rosemary}.
3. Activate {Arrivalrivals} to summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra} **then chain** {Anti-Magic Arrows}. 
4. Activate Ra's effect when prompted to pay your life points to increase its attack and to obtain the ["LP on Brink"](/farming/duel-assessment-score/) bonus.
5. Attack Jesse's life points directly!

##### Replacements
- {Draining Shield}, {Wall of Disruption}, {Curse of Anubis} and {Windstorm of Etaqua} are all just for protection and can be replaced.

#### Lvl: 40 Hazy Farm - credit: [Freeska](/authors/freeska/)
This farm deck will only get ~7,000 [Duel Assessment](/farming/duel-assessment-score/), only use it if you don't have {The Winged Dragon of Ra}.

[deck:Aroma Strategy](Dynatherium; Dynatherium; Dynatherium; Hazy Flame Peryton; Hazy Flame Sphynx; Hazy Flame Sphynx; Hazy Flame Sphynx; Hazy Flame Cerbereus; Hazy Flame Cerbereus; Hazy Flame Cerbereus; Mausoleum of the Emperor; Mausoleum of the Emperor; Mausoleum of the Emperor; Fairy Meteor Crush; Swamp Mirrorer; Swamp Mirrorer; Swamp Mirrorer; Beast Rising; Beast Rising; Beast Rising)

##### Strategy
- Keep on destroying Jesse's monsters each turn.
- Use {Mausoleum of the Emperor} to get ["Low LP" bonus](/farming/duel-assessment-score/).
- Tribute summon a monster to get 300 more Duel Assessment points.
- When you activate {Swamp Mirrorer} declare Beast/Beast-Warrior and any Attribute.
- Boost your Hazy Flame monster to 10,000+ ATK using {Beast Rising}.
- Be aware that {Hazy Flame Peryton} doesn't work with {Beast Rising}.

##### Last Turn 
- Summon a monster by the effect of {Hazy Flame Sphynx} or activate {Swamp Mirrorer}.
- If Jesse has a monster on the field, attack it with you non-boosted monster to clear the field. (If you have a piercing damage you can attack the monster with your boosted monster.) 
- Then attack Jesse's life points directly!

##### Replacements
- {Dynatherium} is optimal but it can be replaced for {Earth Armor Ninja}, or {Flame Tiger}.
- {Mausoleum of the Emperor} can be replaced with {Soul Exchange} if you have it.
- Fairy Meteor Crush can be switched for any card that does piercing damage ({Big Bang Shot}, {H - Heated Heart}) or changes battle position ({Stop Defense}, {A/D Changer}) or even {Shooting Star Bow - Ceal} to attack directly.
