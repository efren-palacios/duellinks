### Farm Decks 

<a name="morrmaniac"></a>

#### Lvl: 40 Fiend Farm - credit: [morrmaniac](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuelLinks/comments/8gfyjb/deck_elegant_mai_lvl_40_necrofear_nani_consistent/) and [シドゾーマバギー海賊団](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QgNYu2MHq7g)

[deck:Labyrinth Builder](Dark Necrofear; Dark Necrofear; Sphere Kuriboh; Sphere Kuriboh; Sphere Kuriboh; Kuriboh; Doomdog Octhros; Doomdog Octhros; Doomdog Octhros; Dark Mimic LV3; Dark Mimic LV3; Dark Mimic LV3; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Dark Mimic LV1; Dark Mimic LV1; Dark Mimic LV1; Anti-Magic Arrows; Union Attack; Union Attack; Shield & Sword)

##### Strategy
- Activate your Skill to play {Labyrinth Wall} shuffling any Spells back into the Deck (or if you have two {Dark Necrofear} in hand, shuffle one back).
- Set {Doomdog Octhros} and {Dark Mimic LV1}/{Dark Mimic LV3} to search for {Dark Necrofear} and thin your Deck.
- Whenever you have enough Monsters in the Graveyard, Special Summon {Dark Necrofear} in Defense position (don't attack with it).
- Mai has many cards to return your Monsters back to your hand/Deck so swarm as soon as you can.   

##### Last Turn 
You should have either one {Labyrinth Wall} and one {Dark Necrofear} or two {Dark Necrofear} on the field. 
1. Activate {Shield & Sword}.
2. Switch your two Monsters into Attack position.
3. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}.
4. Target Vassal with two {Union Attack}.
5. Enter Battle Phase and attack one of Mai's Attack position Monsters with the lowest ATK points!

##### Replacements
- {Sphere Kuriboh} can be replaced with {Kuriboh}.

##### Risks
- You need to Special Summon {Dark Necrofear} as soon as possible since Mai will use {Quill Pen of Gulldos}/{Spiritual Wind Art - Miyabi} to remove your Monsters and attack you directly.

#### Lvl: 30/40 Geargia Farm - credit to [Brenduke](/authors/brenduke/)

[deck:Power of the Tributed](The Winged Dragon of Ra; Geargiattacker; Geargiattacker; Geargianchor; Geargianchor; Geargianchor; Geargiarsenal; Geargiarsenal; Geargiarsenal; Ties of the Brethren; Ties of the Brethren; Ties of the Brethren; Powerful Rebirth; Powerful Rebirth; Powerful Rebirth; Pulse Mines; Pulse Mines; Pulse Mines; Curse of Anubis; Windstorm of Etaqua)

##### Strategy
- Swarm the field and activate the effects of your Geargia Monsters to keep clearing Mai's field.
- Maintain your board presence with {Powerful Rebirth}.
- Use {Pulse Mines}, {Windstorm of Etaqua} and {Curse of Anubis} to defend against any attacks.

##### Last Turn 
1. Clear her field using your Geargia flip effects.
2. Tribute summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra} using your three Monsters.
3. Activate Ra's effect when prompted to pay your life points to increase its attack and to obtain the ["LP on Brink"](/farming/duel-assessment-score/) bonus.
4. Enter Battle Phase and attack Mai's life points directly!

##### Replacements
- You can also play this deck with {Restart} for consistency however, you'll need a copy of {Back-Up Rider} to get over 5,000 damage.
- {Ties of the Brethren} can potentially be replaced with {Enemy Controller}, {A Feint Plan} and other defensive stall cards.
- {Powerful Rebirth} can be replaced with {Floodgate Trap Hole}.

##### Risks
- This Deck can be used against Lvl: 30, however she has a single copy of {Destruction Ring} which she could potentially use to defeat you after paying for the effect of {The Winged Dragon of Ra}.

### Lvl: 40 Hazy Farm - credit to Rezileen

[deck:Aroma Strategy](Dynatherium; Dynatherium; Hazy Flame Sphynx; Hazy Flame Sphynx; Hazy Flame Sphynx; Hazy Flame Cerbereus; Hazy Flame Cerbereus; Hazy Flame Cerbereus; Cosmic Cyclone; Cosmic Cyclone; Cosmic Cyclone; Soul Exchange; Soul Exchange; H - Heated Heart; Swamp Mirrorer; Swamp Mirrorer; Swamp Mirrorer; Beast Rising; Beast Rising; Beast Rising)

##### Strategy
- Summon {Hazy Flame Sphynx} as soon as possible! You don't need these exact cards (especially since they're expensive and difficult to obtain), but these are arguably the most optimal. 
- Once Hazy Flame Sphynx is out, keep boosting her with {Beast Rising}. Always declare "Beast"/"Beast Warrior" for {Swamp Mirrorer}.
- Don't attack with Hazy Flame Sphynx until it has ~5600 ATK because Mai has {Mirror Wall}. 
- It doesn't matter if she destroys {Beast Rising} by the effect of {Harpies' Hunting Ground} as long as Hazy Flame Sphynx got one boost, she can't get over it. This also lets you stall until you draw another Beast Rising. 
- If you didn't draw Beast Rising, keep attacking her Monsters so that she can't Summon {Swift Birdman Joe}.
- Be wary not to attack during the third and second to last turns of the farm, as you may destory {Harpie Lady 3} who's effect will stop you cold.
- This should get you 7,000 [Duel Assessment](/farming/duel-assessment-score/) consistently and can hit 8,000. Use {Cosmic Cyclone} to lower your LP for a ["Comeback Victory"](/farming/duel-assessment-score/), and remember to do a Tribute Summon. 

##### Last Turn
Make sure {Hazy Flame Sphynx} has over 10,000 ATK so that even if she activates {Mirror Wall}, you will still do enough damage to defeat her. 
- Use {Cosmic Cyclones} to clear her backrow if you have the LP. If you want to be safe, you could put in an {Anti-Magic Arrows} to prevent her activating Mirror Wall.
- Activate {H - Heated Heart}, targeting your boosted Hazy Flame Sphynx.
- Enter the Battle Phase, and attack the Monster with the lowest DEF points!

##### Replacements
- {Soul Exchange}/{Dynatherium} can be replaced by {Mausoleum of the Emperor}/{Fire Formation - Tensu}.
- {H - Heated Heart} can be any piercing card: {Big Bang Shot}, {Fairy Metero Crush} etc.

##### Risks
- Since this is a Hazy Flame Deck do expect it to brick sometimes.
