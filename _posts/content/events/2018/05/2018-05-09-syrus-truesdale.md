*We will update soon with more farm Decks, watch this space!*

#### Lvl: 40 Ra Farm - credit: [Freeska](/authors/freeska/)
Any variation of the "Ra Deck" may work but perhaps not as effectively. For example, {Kiseitai} + {Massivemorph}, {Golden Ladybug} etc. 

[deck:Restart](The Winged Dragon of Ra; A Cat of Ill Omen; A Cat of Ill Omen; Skelengel; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird; Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird; Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird; White Magician Pikeru; White Magician Pikeru; Anti-Magic Arrows; Magic Planter; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Astral Barrier; Astral Barrier; Astral Barrier)

##### Strategy
- Get both {Spirit Barrier} and {Astral Barrier} on the field as soon as possible.
- Summon {Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird} and {White Magician Pikeru} to gain life points.
- Dodge Syrus' attacks with your "Barrier" combo.
- **Tip:** To save time, quickly tap/un-tap "Auto Duel" during Syrus' Battle Phase so you don't have to activate {Astral Barrier} on each attack declaration.

##### Last Turn
Make sure you have three Monsters on the field before the last turn.
1. Tribute summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra} using your three Monsters.
2. Activate Ra's effect when prompted to pay your life points to increase its attack and to obtain the ["LP on Brink"](/farming/duel-assessment-score/) bonus.
3. Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} and attack the Attack postion Monster with the lowest ATK!

##### Replacements
- {Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird} and {White Magician Pikeru} can be replaced by {Cure Mermaid}.
- {Magic Planter} can be replaced with any generic card that lets you draw.
- A good option instead of {Crystal Seer} or {Skelengel} is {Defense Draw}, which is not prone to Syrus' {Shield Crush}.

##### Risks
- Not getting the "Barrier" combo out quick enough is deadly.
- If you're not careful with how you use your draw power, you won't have 3 monsters on the field by the last turn and won't be able to Tribute Summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra}.

### Lvl: 30 Blue-Eyes Farm

[deck:Restart](Kaibaman; Kaibaman; Blue Dragon Summoner; Blue Dragon Summoner; Blue Dragon Summoner; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Blue-Eyes White Dragon; Blue-Eyes White Dragon; Blue-Eyes White Dragon; Anti-Magic Arrows; Union Attack; Union Attack; Wonder Wand; Wonder Wand; Wonder Wand; Ancient Rules; Ancient Rules; Secret Pass to the Treasures)

##### Strategy
- Activate {Restart} if you don't have a way to Summon {Blue-Eyes White Dragon} or search for it.
- Only attack Defense position Monsters so you don't lose the ["Effect Only Damage"](/farming/duel-assessment-score/) bonus. 
- Thin your Deck with {Blue Dragon Summoner} and {Crystal Seer} + {Wonder Wand}.

##### Last Turn 
You should have two {Blue-Eyes White Dragon} on the field. 

1. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}.
2. Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}.
3. Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} and attack directly for victory!

##### Replacements
- {Crystal Seer} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by "Drawing" in the Card Editor), for example, {Dark Mimic LV1}, {Dark Mimic LV3}, {Dekoichi the Battlechanted Locomotive}, {Jar of Greed}, {Shard of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc.
