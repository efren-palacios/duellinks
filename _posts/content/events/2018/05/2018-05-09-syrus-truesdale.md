### Top Player Council Thoughts

<a name="q1"></a>

#### "Do the new "roid" cards have the potential to produce a new top-tier Deck?"

<br>

**[Whilipino](/top-player-council/whilipino/)** says:
- No, the Deck is still trash. 

**[Kwrowe](/top-player-council/kwrowe/)** says:
- No!

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- Nope!

**[Super Vegito](/top-player-council/super-vegito/)** says:
- Definitely not.

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- ðŸš®

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- OMEGALUL Trash.

**[AndyTsang](/top-player-council/andytsang/)** says:
- No!

<a name="q2"></a>

#### "Will any of the new "roid" cards be used in a current top-tier Deck?"

<br>

**[Whilipino](/top-player-council/whilipino/)** says:
- {Drillroid} is a cool card for Side Decks and it's another option for {Ties of the Brethren} with [Geargias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/).

**[Kwrowe](/top-player-council/kwrowe/)** says:
- No!

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- Absolutely not.

**[Super Vegito](/top-player-council/super-vegito/)** says:
- No!

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- ðŸš®

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- Maybe {Drillroid}, but would probably use something like {Tribute to the Doomed} instead for better removal.

**[AndyTsang](/top-player-council/andytsang/)** says:
- No!

#### "Will you personally be farming this event?"

<br>

**[Whilipino](/top-player-council/whilipino/)** says:
- Yes, because I farm every event.

**[Kwrowe](/top-player-council/kwrowe/)** says:
- No!

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- Sure, new character means more Gems.

**[Super Vegito](/top-player-council/super-vegito/)** says:
- No, I'll be auto-dueling, none of the cards    are worth it.

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- Yes, but that's because this game is an addiction, still ðŸš®.

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- For 3 of every card, yes.

**[AndyTsang](/top-player-council/andytsang/)** says:
- Yes!

### Farm Decks 

<a name="freeska"></a>

#### Lvl: 40 Ra Farm - credit: [Freeska](/authors/freeska/)
Any variation of the "Ra Deck" may work but perhaps not as effectively. For example, {Kiseitai} + {Massivemorph}, {Golden Ladybug} etc. 

[deck:Restart](The Winged Dragon of Ra; A Cat of Ill Omen; A Cat of Ill Omen; Skelengel; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird; Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird; Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird; White Magician Pikeru; White Magician Pikeru; Anti-Magic Arrows; Magic Planter; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Astral Barrier; Astral Barrier; Astral Barrier)

##### Strategy
- Get both {Spirit Barrier} and {Astral Barrier} on the field as soon as possible.
- Summon {Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird} and {White Magician Pikeru} to gain life points.
- Dodge Syrus' attacks with your "Barrier" combo.
- **Tip:** To save time, quickly tap/un-tap "Auto Duel" during Syrus' Battle Phase so you don't have to activate {Astral Barrier} on each attack declaration.

##### Last Turn
Make sure you have three Monsters on the field before the last turn.
1. Tribute summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra} using your three Monsters.
2. Activate Ra's effect when prompted to pay your life points to increase its attack and to obtain the ["LP on Brink"](/farming/duel-assessment-score/) bonus.
3. Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} and attack the Attack postion Monster with the lowest ATK!

##### Replacements
- {Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird} and {White Magician Pikeru} can be replaced by {Cure Mermaid}.
- {Magic Planter} can be replaced with any generic card that lets you draw.
- A good option instead of {Crystal Seer} or {Skelengel} is {Defense Draw}, which is not prone to Syrus' {Shield Crush}.

##### Risks
- Not getting the "Barrier" combo out quick enough is deadly.
- If you're not careful with how you use your draw power, you won't have 3 monsters on the field by the last turn and won't be able to Tribute Summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra}.

### Lvl: 30 Blue-Eyes Farm

[deck:Restart](Kaibaman; Kaibaman; Blue Dragon Summoner; Blue Dragon Summoner; Blue Dragon Summoner; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Blue-Eyes White Dragon; Blue-Eyes White Dragon; Blue-Eyes White Dragon; Anti-Magic Arrows; Union Attack; Union Attack; Wonder Wand; Wonder Wand; Wonder Wand; Ancient Rules; Ancient Rules; Secret Pass to the Treasures)

##### Strategy
- Activate {Restart} if you don't have a way to Summon {Blue-Eyes White Dragon} or search for it.
- Only attack Defense position Monsters so you don't lose the ["Effect Only Damage"](/farming/duel-assessment-score/) bonus. 
- Thin your Deck with {Blue Dragon Summoner} and {Crystal Seer} + {Wonder Wand}.

##### Last Turn 
You should have two {Blue-Eyes White Dragon} on the field. 

1. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}.
2. Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}.
3. Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} and attack directly for victory!

##### Replacements
- {Crystal Seer} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by "Drawing" in the Card Editor), for example, {Dark Mimic LV1}, {Dark Mimic LV3}, {Dekoichi the Battlechanted Locomotive}, {Jar of Greed}, {Shard of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc.
