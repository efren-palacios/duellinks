### Farm Decks 

#### Level 40 Farm - created by Jadehex

[deck: Restart](Saffira, Queen of Dragons; Saffira, Queen of Dragons; Saffira, Queen of Dragons; Cyber Angel Idaten; Cyber Angel Benten; Cyber Angel Benten; Senju of the Thousand Hands; Senju of the Thousand Hands; Senju of the Thousand Hands; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Cyber Petit Angel; Anti-Magic Arrows; Union Attack; Union Attack; Hymn of Light; Hymn of Light; Machine Angel Ritual; Sprite's Blessing; Sprite's Blessing;Secret Pass to the Treasures)

**Strategy**
- Summon {Saffira, Queen of Dragons} as soon as possible
- Boost the attack of your monsters with {Cyber Angel Idaten}
- Use {Saffira, Queen of Dragons} 'Draw 2, Discard 1' effect to try and dump a {Hymn of Light} or {Machine Angel Ritual} for protection
 
**Last Turn** 
- Make sure you only have 2 Ritual Monsters on the field before the last turn
- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} and target him with your {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
- Enter Battle Phase, use {Anti-Magic Arrows}, and swing for victory

**Replacements**
- {Senju of the Thousand Hands} can be replaced with {Gishki Chain} or {Cyber Petit Angel}
- A copy of {Saffira, Queen of Dragons} can be replaced with {Cyber Angel Dakini}

**Risks**
- As with most Cyber Angel decks, this is prone to bricking if you don't open with your Ritual Spells
- Lacking protection in your graveyard with {Hymn of Light} or {Machine Angel Ritual} can leave your monsters open to getting destroyed by Syrus' {Drillroid} or {Shield Crush}

#### Level 40 Farm - created by Clashbruh

[deck](The Winged Dragon of Ra; Golden Ladybug; Golden Ladybug; Golden Ladybug; Cosmic Compass; Anti-Magic Arrows; Double Summon; Stop Defense; Defense Draw; Defense Draw; Wall of Disruption; Wall of Disruption; Draining Shield; Draining Shield; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Massivemorph)

**Strategy**
- Stall until the last turn using your Trap Cards
- Gain as much life as possible (more than 5K by the last turn is sufficient)
- Shuffle endgame cards back into your deck with {Good Goblin Housekeeping}

**Last Turn** 
- Activate {Double Summon}
- Summon {Cosmic Compass} and summon 2 tokens with his effect
- Tribute these tokens to summon {The Winged Dragon of Ra} and use his effect on summon
- Target one of Syrus' monsters with {Stop Defense}
- Enter Battle Phase, activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} and swing into the attack position monster for game


**Replacements**
- Ratios of cards are mostly unimportant
- {Enchanted Javelin}, {Windstorm of Etaqua} and {Curse of Anubis} also work as stall cards
- {Kiseitai} is not recommend due to {Drillroid} and {Shield Crush}
- Most skills can be used with this deck

**Risks**
- You can possibly get OTKed before being able to control the board if you open with too many endgame cards

#### Level 40 Farm - created by Jadehex

[deck: Restart](Red-Eyes Wyvern; Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon; Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon; Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Red-Eyes Black Dragon; Red-Eyes Black Dragon; Red-Eyes Black Dragon; Anti-Magic Arrows; Red-Eyes Insight; Red-Eyes Insight; Red-Eyes Insight; Union Attack; Union Attack; Cards of the Red Stone; Cards of the Red Stone; Cards of the Red Stone; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Red-Eyes Spirit; Red-Eyes Spirit)

**Strategy**
- Restart for a way to summon a Red-Eyes monster as soon as possible using {Red-Eyes Spirit}. Opening with {Red-Eyes Insight} is optimal
- Summon multiple Red-Eyes monsters
- Attack into all his monsters so that he can't summon {Super Vehicroid Jumbo Drill}
- He *can* kill one of your Red-Eyes using {Shield Crush} 

**Last Turn** 
- Make sure you only have 2 Red-Eyes monsters on the field before the last turn
- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} and target him with your {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
- Enter Battle Phase, use {Anti-Magic Arrows}, and swing for victory

**Replacements**
- {Red-Eyes Wyvern} could be replaced with {Black Dragon's Chick}

**Risks**
- The bricking is deadly in this deck, but it's incredibly fast

#### Level 40 Farm - created by Freeska

[deck: Reinforcements](The Legendary Fisherman; Thunder Dragon; Thunder Dragon; Thunder Dragon; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Anti-Magic Arrows; A Legendary Ocean; A Legendary Ocean; A Legendary Ocean; Union Attack; Polymerization; Magical Mallet; Magical Mallet; Magical Mallet; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon)

**Strategy**
- Use {Magical Mallet} to get a copy of {A Legendary Ocean} and {Spirit Barrier} in your hand as fast as possible
- Use the Reinforcements skill to get {The Legendary Fisherman} into your hand
- Once you have these 3 cards on the field, you're safe from everything

**Last Turn** 
- Use {Polymerization} to Fusion Summon {Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon}
- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} and target him with your {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
- Enter Battle Phase, use {Anti-Magic Arrows}, and swing for victory

**Replacements**
- {Crystal Seer} can be swapped out for basically any card that helps you draw, such as {Skelengel}

**Risks**
- Again, if you don't open well and can't fish out your combo pieces then it's game over
- This is one of the least consistent farm decks, but requires much less interaction than the others
