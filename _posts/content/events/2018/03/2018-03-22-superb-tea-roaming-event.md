### Top Player Council Thoughts

#### **[Superforms](/authors/superforms/)** says: 

- {Meltiel, Sage of the Sky} (UR): The core monster of Counter Fairies. Counter Traps are a tricky thing to slide into a deck in general because they can’t always deal with established threats (like a [REZ](/tier-list/red-eyes-zombies/), for example). Meltiel gives you extra ways to deal with things that don’t get directly destroyed by your Counter Traps. This is incredibly important because it gives you a way to mitigate the effects of going second. The LP gain is also not insignificant, giving you more fuel for {Seven Tools of the Bandit} and {Solemn Scolding}.
- {Divine Punishment} (SR): Negates a ton of stuff while the Field Spell ({The Sanctuary in the Sky}) is up. A very versatile negation card with no discard cost. Divine Punishment notably cannot stop already face-up backrow ({Sea Stealth Attack}, {Beast Rising}, {Call of the Archfiend}) nor can it stop normal summons (like Solemn Scolding can). 
- {Harvest Angel of Wisdom} (SR): Could see use in more defensive Counter Fairy decks that run less Counter Traps and take advantage of Harvest’s recycling effect.
- {Zeradias, Herald of Heaven} (SR): {Elemental HERO Captain Gold} for Counter Fairies. Searches the Field Spell ({The Sanctuary in the Sky}), adding consistency, and extra copies work as big beaters.
- {Radiant Jeral} (SR): Decent wall and boosts your LP if discarded for a Counter Trap cost with Sanctuary on the field, but pretty terrible relative to the other cards.
- {Photon Booster} (R): The first thing that comes to mind is the {Ra's Disciple} OTK deck, although there will likely be other uses.

Older cards that work well with these include {Bountiful Artemis} and {Cards from the Sky}. Also note that {The Sanctuary in the Sky} is an R Ticket reward from Ranked Duels, so that may be a worthwhile use for your R Tickets this season!

### Farm Deck

#### Level 40 Farm - created by Jadehex (100% Winrate!)

[deck:Elements Unite!](Thunder Dragon; Thunder Dragon; Thunder Dragon; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Caligo Claw Crow; Union Attack; Union Attack; Union Attack; Spiritualism; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Legacy of Yata-Garasu; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed)   

**Strategy**
- Summon {Gate Guardian}
- Use your draw cards to finish the Duel quicker 
- Only attack if {Meltiel, Sage of the Sky} is face-up 
- Don't activate anything that can be countered - [check out her Decklist](#40)

**Last Turn** 
- Activate {Spiritualism} returning her Field Spell ({The Sanctuary in the Sky}) to her hand
- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} and special summon {Caligo Claw Crow} 
- Target Vassal with your three {Union Attack} (she may negate one with {Magic Jammer} but it doesn't matter) and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
- Enter Battle Phase and swing for victory!

**Replacements**
- {Thunder Dragon}, {Shard of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu}, {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by 'Drawing' in the Card Editor)
- {Caligo Claw Crow} can be replaced for {Blustering Winds}
- Replace {Spiritualism} and one Draw card with either {Fire Formation - Gyokkou} or {Hey, Trunade!}. Use these to clear the backrow (not Field Spell). Also, it doesn't matter if they're negated as they're 1 for 1

**Risks**
- If you follow the method above it's risk free - 100% winrate!
