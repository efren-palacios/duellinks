### Water Dimension Pack

If you missed out on the last D.D. Tower - Water event, you have another chance to obtain its exclusive cards in the Water Dimension Pack found in the D.D. Box.

[deck](Sirenorca; Medium of the Ice Barrier; Gishki Ariel; Gishki Natalia; Gishki Emilia; Water Girl; Ice Water)

{Gishki Ariel} is an important card to note, as it is now seeing play in top tier Sea Stealth Attack decks, such as the one [Dkayed recently used to reach King of Games](/top-decks/march-2018/sea-stealth-attack/-citadel-whale-is-overrrated-and-gishkis-are-trash-dkayed-2018-by-stealth-sub/). Competitive players without this card should consider grinding for it.

The rest of these cards currently have no competitive value.

### Duel Mission Tips

![icon](/img/content/events/2018/03/dd-tower-wind-and-earth-dimension/icon.png)

If you're aiming for the 100% completion Karate Man icon above and are stuck on a mission, try out some of these tips:
- {Ancient Gear Explosive} combined with {Ancient Gear Golem} and Dr. Crowler's {Middle Age Mechs} skill can be used to inflict 1500 points of effect damage.
- {Kickfire} along with Fire attribute monsters can also inflict up to 2000 points of burn damage.
- Using {LP Boost Î±}, available on many characters, can heal your Life Points from Duel to Duel.
- Chazz's {Ojama Overflow} skill, which triggers at 500 LP or below, can be used to stall many of the decks you will face, making specific objectives much easier to complete.
- On the character screen before you hit 'Duel' you can click the card button to see some cards that could be used to help complete an objective.

Here are some tips on how to complete the missions for each floor
