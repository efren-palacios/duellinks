### Water Dimension Pack

If you missed out on the last D.D. Tower - Water event, you have another chance to obtain its exclusive cards in the Water Dimension Pack found in the D.D. Box.

[deck](Sirenorca; Medium of the Ice Barrier; Gishki Ariel; Gishki Natalia; Gishki Emilia; Water Girl; Ice Water)

{Gishki Ariel} is an important card to note, as it is now seeing play in top tier Sea Stealth Attack decks, such as the one [Dkayed recently used to reach King of Games](/top-decks/march-2018/sea-stealth-attack/-citadel-whale-is-overrrated-and-gishkis-are-trash-dkayed-2018-by-stealth-sub/). Competitive players without this card should consider grinding for it.

The rest of these cards currently have no competitive value.

### Mission Tips

If you're aiming for the Karate Man icon above and are stuck on a mission, try out some of these tips:
- {Ancient Gear Explosive} combined with {Ancient Gear Golem} and Dr. Crowler's {Middle Aged Mechs} skill can be used to inflict 1500 points of burn damage.
- {Kickfire} along with Fire attribute monsters can also inflict up to 2000 points of burn damage.
- Using {LP Boost Î±}, available on many characters, can heal your Life Points from duel to duel.
- Chazz's {Ojama Overflow} skill, which triggers at 500 LP or below, can be used to stall many of the decks you will face, making specific objectives much easier to complete.
- On the character screen before you hit 'Duel' you can click the card button to see some cards that could be used to help complete an objective.
