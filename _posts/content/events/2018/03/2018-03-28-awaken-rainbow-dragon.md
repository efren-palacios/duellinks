### Update

- Don't forget to fill out the [event survey](/news/april-2018/in-game-updates/) - let Konami know what's on your mind!

![](/img/content/events/2018/03/awaken-rainbow-dragon/jesse-lvl-50.png)

Jesse Lvl. 50 will now spawn in Duel World (GX) with a [stronger deck](#50) in tow!
   
- He will use {Rainbow Path} to negate your attack so substitute a non-essential card in the [Cerberus Farm Deck](#jadehex2) (since Jesse appears only in Duel World (GX) you won't be able to use the skills required for the other decks) for {Anti-Magic Arrows}, {Hey, Trunade!}, {Fire Formation - Gyokkou}, {Nobleman of Extermination} etc. Alternatively, {Trap Jammer} or {Seven Tools of the Bandit} would also suffice however it's more risky since they could be the last card in your deck.
 
New event Missions have also been added - get up to 100 Gems!

| Mission | Reward | 
|--|--|
| Win 1 Duel with {Rainbow Dragon} in your Deck, while playing as Jesse Anderson | 10 Gems |
| Summon {Rainbow Dragon} 1 time in PvP | 20 Gems |
| Summon {Rainbow Dragon} 2 times in PvP | 20 Gems |
| Summon {Rainbow Dragon} 3 times in PvP | 20 Gems |
| Reduce your opponent's LP to 0 by inflicting battle damage with {Rainbow Dragon} | 30 Gems |

### Farm Decks

<a name="jadehex"></a>
#### Level 40 Cloudian Farm - created by Jadehex

[deck:Draw Sense: WATER](Summoner of Illusions; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Cloudian - Turbulence; Union Attack; Union Attack; The Sanctuary in the Sky; The Sanctuary in the Sky; The Sanctuary in the Sky; Dimensionhole; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Jar of Greed; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping)
[deck](Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon; Master of Oz)    

**Strategy**
- You win if you have {Cloudian - Turbulence} + {The Sanctuary in the Sky}/{Spirit Barrier} combo!
- If you don't have Cloudian - Turbulence in your opening hand take 1500 damage so you can activate your skill and draw it
- Use {Zeradias, Herald of Heaven} to search for the Field Spell
- Use {Good Goblin Housekeeping} to draw into {Summoner of Illusions} and {Dimensionhole} - you'll need them **before** the last turn so **don't** return them to the bottom of the deck! 
- Set Summoner of Illusions second to last turn and activate Dimensionhole banishing it (so it doesn't get destroyed)

**Last Turn** 
You should only have {Cloudian - Turbulence} and a facedown {Summoner of Illusions} in your Monster zones

- Flip summon Summoner of Illusions and tribute Cloudian - Turbulence to special summon {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon}/{Master of Oz}
- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
- Enter Battle Phase and swing for victory!

**Replacements**
- {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by 'Drawing' in the Card Editor), for example, {Shard of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc. However, if you replace Good Goblin Housekeeping you'll need to add {Pot of Benevolence} to avoid drawing {Summoner of Illusions} or {Dimensionhole} last

**Risks**
- Technically {Crystal Beast Amethyst Cat} gets through {The Sanctuary in the Sky} but it shouldn't be a common issue

#### Level 40 Unhappy Girl Farm - created by Hi_Im_Flabber

[deck:Holy Guard](Mystical Beast of Serket; Gravekeeper's Vassal; The Unhappy Girl; The Unhappy Girl; The Unhappy Girl; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Rai-Mei; Rai-Mei; Rai-Mei; Union Attack; Union Attack; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Temple of the Kings; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping)
[deck](Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon)   

**Strategy**
- Lock down Jesse's monsters with {The Unhappy Girl} 
- Only summon two The Unhappy Girl as you need one free zone for {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Attack his monsters with The Unhappy Girl to 'lock' them down so they can't attack (you take no battle damage with {Holy Guard})
- Before the last turn, ensure {Temple of the Kings} is on the field and tribute summon {Mystical Beast of Serket} - tribute both to special summon {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon}
- Use your draw cards to finish the Duel quicker

**Last Turn**
You should only have one {The Unhappy Girl} and Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon in your Monster zones

- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
- Enter Battle Phase and swing for victory!

**Replacements**
- {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Shard of Greed} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by 'Drawing' in the Card Editor), for example, {Jar of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc. However, if you replace Good Goblin Housekeeping you'll need to add {Pot of Benevolence} to avoid drawing {Temple of the Kings} or {Mystical Beast of Serket} last
- {Crystal Seer} can be replaced by {Skelengel}, {Dekoichi the Battlechanted Locomotive}, {Dark Mimic LV1} etc

#### Level 40 Cerberus Farm - created by Jadehex

**This is just a generic Cerberus farm decklist, you can optimize it however you want!**

[deck:Draw Sense: LIGHT](Mythical Beast Cerberus; Riryoku; Gaia Power; Spell Power Grasp; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Wonder Wand; Wonder Wand; Twister; Blustering Winds; Blustering Winds; Blustering Winds; Stop Defense; Pot of Benevolence; Hieroglyph Lithograph; Hieroglyph Lithograph; Blue Medicine; Mooyan Curry; Mooyan Curry)   

**Strategy**
- Take 1500 Damage so you can activate {Draw Sense: LIGHT} to draw {Mythical Beast Cerberus}.
- Summon Cerberus and activate enough Spells so it has ATK points higher than what Jesse can reach (3000 ATK is a safe point since {Crystal Beast Topaz Tiger} + {Crystal Release} = 2800 ATK).
- Keep activating Spells until you draw the last card of your deck.
- Use these cards to manage your LP so you can achieve ['LP on the Brink'](/farming/duel-assessment-score/).
    - 2x {Hieroglyph Lithograph} or {Abyssal Designator}
	- 2x {Mooyan Curry}
	- 1x {Blue Medicine}
	- 1x {Twister}
	- 1x {Pot of Benevolence}

**Last Turn**
- Use {Stop Defense} and then {Riryoku} on one of Jesse's Monsters.
- Activate all the Spells left in your hand but prioritize reaching 100 LP unless you don't have enough ATK points to deal 9999+ Damage.
- Finally, attack his Attack position Monster and claim victory!

**Replacements**
- Literally none of the spells matter except {Stop Defense} and {Riryoku} as long as you can still deal 9999+ Damage.
- {Stop Defense} can be replaced by {Shooting Star Bow - Ceal}, {Big Bang Shot}, {Fairy Meteor Crush} etc.
- Skill can be swapped for {Draw Sense: Low Level}.

#### Level 40 Labyrinth Builder Farm - created by InfiniteFlash

[deck:Labyrinth Builder](The Fiend Megacyber; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Planet Pathfinder; Planet Pathfinder; Planet Pathfinder; Union Attack; Union Attack; Shield & Sword; Acidic Downpour; Acidic Downpour; Acidic Downpour; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Wall of Disruption; Wall of Disruption; Wall of Disruption; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed)

**Strategy**
- Activate your skill to play {Labyrinth Wall}.
- Idealy you want to open with at least 1 {Wall of Disruption}, 1 {Planet Pathfinder} (to search for {Acidic Downpour}), or 1 Acidic Downpour.
- When you manage to play one of these cards against Jesse, his monsters won't be able to get over your Labyrinth Wall.  
- Then you are free to draw into all your cards for the final turn.

**Last Turn**
1. Activate {Shield & Sword}.
2. Switch {Labyrinth Wall} into Attack position.
3. Special Summon {The Fiend Megacyber}.
4. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}.
5. Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}.
6. Enter Battle Phase - attack Jesse's life points directly!

**Replacements**
- {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by 'Drawing' in the Card Editor), for example, {Shard of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc.
