### Farm Decks

<a name="jadehex"></a>
#### Level 40 Cloudian Farm - created by Jadehex

[deck:Draw Sense: WATER](Summoner of Illusions; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Zeradias, Herald of Heaven; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Cloudian - Turbulence; Union Attack; Union Attack; The Sanctuary in the Sky; The Sanctuary in the Sky; The Sanctuary in the Sky; Dimensionhole; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Jar of Greed; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Spirit Barrier; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping)
[deck](Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon; Master of Oz)    

**Strategy**
- You win if you have {Cloudian - Turbulence} + {The Sanctuary in the Sky}/{Spirit Barrier} combo!
- If you don't have Cloudian - Turbulence in your opening hand take 1500 damage so you can activate your skill and draw it
- Use {Zeradias, Herald of Heaven} to search for the Field Spell
- Use {Good Goblin Housekeeping} to draw into {Summoner of Illusions} and {Dimensionhole} - you'll need them **before** the last turn so **don't** return them to the bottom of the deck! 
- Set Summoner of Illusions second to last turn and activate Dimensionhole banishing it (so it doesn't get destroyed)

**Last Turn** 
You should only have {Cloudian - Turbulence} and a facedown {Summoner of Illusions} in your Monster zones

- Flip summon Summoner of Illusions and tribute Cloudian - Turbulence to special summon {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon}/{Master of Oz}
- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
- Enter Battle Phase and swing for victory!

**Replacements**
- {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by 'Drawing' in the Card Editor), for example, {Shard of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc. However, if you replace Good Goblin Housekeeping you'll need to add {Pot of Benevolence} to avoid drawing {Summoner of Illusions} or {Dimensionhole} last

**Risks**
- Technically {Crystal Beast Amethyst Cat} gets through {The Sanctuary in the Sky} but it shouldn't be a common issue

#### Level 40 Unhappy Girl Farm - created by Hi_Im_Flabber

[deck:Holy Guard](Mystical Beast of Serket; Gravekeeper's Vassal; The Unhappy Girl; The Unhappy Girl; The Unhappy Girl; Crystal Seer; Crystal Seer; Rai-Mei; Rai-Mei; Rai-Mei; Union Attack; Union Attack; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Temple of the Kings; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping)
[deck](Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon)   

**Strategy**
- Lock down Jesse's monsters with {The Unhappy Girl} 
- Only summon two The Unhappy Girl as you need one free zone for {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Attack his monsters with The Unhappy Girl to 'lock' them down so they can't attack (you take no battle damage with {Holy Guard})
- Before the last turn, ensure {Temple of the Kings} is on the field and tribute summon {Mystical Beast of Serket} - tribute both to special summon {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon}
- Use your draw cards to finish the Duel quicker

**Last Turn**
You should only have one {The Unhappy Girl} and Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon in your Monster zones

- Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
- Target Vassal with two {Union Attack} and {Secret Pass to the Treasures}
- Enter Battle Phase and swing for victory!

**Replacements**
- {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Shard of Greed} can be replaced by other draw cards (filter by 'Drawing' in the Card Editor), for example, {Jar of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc. However, if you replace Good Goblin Housekeeping you'll need to add {Pot of Benevolence} to avoid drawing {Temple of the Kings} or {Mystical Beast of Serket} last
- {Crystal Seer} can be replaced by {Skelengel}, {Dekoichi the Battlechanted Locomotive}, {Dark Mimic LV1} etc
