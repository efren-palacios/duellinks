### Update

Due to several questions from people that are unable to build a {Mokey Mokey} deck, we have milled Tristan Taylor several times to see what his deck looks like. Jadehex, our Farm Expert, has posted an advanced farm deck for people that have not invested in [Abyss Encounters](/box-reviews/abyss-encounters/)!

### Event Information 
- Tristan Taylor has arrived!
- This event lasts from March 31st to April 2nd.

### Event Strategy

1. Click through the Spawn dialogue.
2. Tristan Taylor will now appear as a Legendary Duelist in Duel World (DM). 
3. You need 3 {Mokey Mokey} and a {Polymerization} in your Deck, as well as a {Mokey Mokey King} in your Extra Deck.
4. Order food on Panda Express and start your first Duel against Tristan Taylor. This one should be very easy with one of the farm decks below. If you summon {Mokey Mokey King} the duel automatically ends!
5. Several more Tristan Taylors will now spawn in the Duel World (DM).
6. Use {Shine Palace} in the next Duels against Tristan Taylor to power up {Mokey Mokey King} immediately (this is very important).
7. Engage all other Tristan Taylors and win the duels, so you can get the Game Mat and Card Sleeves for this event.
8. The 6th Tristan Taylor will finally drop {Obelisk the Tormentor}!
9. From then on you can attempt (good luck!) to farm him.

Once you're done you'll have to wait for April 1st 2019 to get another copy of {Obelisk the Tormentor}.

### Event Missions
