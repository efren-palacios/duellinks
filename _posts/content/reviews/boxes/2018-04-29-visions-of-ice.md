### [Top Player Council](/top-player-council/) - First Impressions

<a name="q1"></a>

#### "What are your first impressions of Spellbooks/Prophecy?"

<br>

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- They're missing some crucial cards that would make Spellbooks tier 1. However, {Spellbook of Secrets}, {Spellbook of Power} and {Spellbook of Fate} are a nice addition to Spellcaster Decks.

**[MiguelJoker](/top-player-council/migueljoker/)** says:
- They will be tier 1, {Spellbook of Fate} is broken.

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- Very strong engine using {Spellbook of Secrets} and {Spellbook Magician of Prophecy} to search for your Spellbook cards. 
- The Prophecy Monsters such as {Prophecy Destroyer} and {Justice of Prophecy} are mediocre at best. There aren't any great boss Monsters but potentially other boss Monsters can be mixed in such as {Dark Magician} or {Endymion, the Master Magician}.

**[Kaki](/top-player-council/kaki/)** says:
- It's a really good engine. {Spellbook of Fate} is a powerful card and a great counter to [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/) or [Geargias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/).

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- It's a lot to read up and I'm not very familiar with the archetype, it seems like it will have some crazy potential with {Endymion, the Master Magician}.

#### "What are your first impressions of Gustos?"

<br>

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- Cute little Psychic engine, boosts playability, but won’t be a top tier Deck anytime soon.

**[MiguelJoker](/top-player-council/migueljoker/)** says:
- They're not good enough.

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- They provide more Psychic support and can use {Psychokinesis} and {Serene Psychic Witch}. 
- They seem like a Beatdown Deck, with high attack Monsters like {Reeze, Whirlwind of Gusto} and {Caam, Serenity of Gusto}.
- {Contact with Gusto} is a nice removal card along with {Quill Pen of Gulldos} which is already in the game.

**[Kaki](/top-player-council/kaki/)** says:
- It is too slow for the meta. 

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- They're pretty bad. It's a sort of upgraded Naturia Deck, it won't make an impact.

#### "Which cards do you think are absolutely needed?"

<br>

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- {Treacherous Trap Hole} will be definitely see play in [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/) and Decks that play few Traps such as [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/). It's an amazing Trap card that can destroy 2 of your opponent’s Monsters.

**[MiguelJoker](/top-player-council/migueljoker/)** says:
- {Treacherous Trap Hole} and Spellbooks.

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- {Spellbook Magician of Prophecy} is a must have searcher for Spellbooks if they become top tier and the same for {Spellbook of Secrets}.

**[Kaki](/top-player-council/kaki/)** says:
- {Treacherous Trap Hole} will be good in Spellbooks, [Cyber Angels](/tier-list/deck-types/cyber-angels/) and [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/).

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- {Treacherous Trap Hole} is overpowered - [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/) just went from tier 1 to tier 0 if they're not already there. It will 100% see use.

#### "Which cards do you think are maybe needed in some Decks?"

<br>

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- {Spellbook of Fate} is a very powerful Quick-Play Spell that allows you to disrupt your opponent, it may bring some Spellcaster Decks back onto the [Tier List](/tier-list/).

**[MiguelJoker](/top-player-council/migueljoker/)** says:
- Definitely Spellbooks, {Treacherous Trap Hole} and perhaps {Tribute Burial} too.

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- {Treacherous Trap Hole} is a great removal card. The drawback is that it will be hard to pull off if you play other Traps but if you don't play other Traps and only one Treacherous Trap Hole you won't see it as often. 

**[Kaki](/top-player-council/kaki/)** says:
- {Tribute Burial} will maybe provide support for Tribute Decks.

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- {Blizzard Princess} gives you a free turn to do whatever you want and still allows you to to activate your own Spell/Trap cards, like "{Enemy Controller} take" or even OTK cards.

#### "Which cards do you think have future potential?"

<br>

**[Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/)** says:
- {Dragon Ice} works great as a wall and can be summoned from the hand or Graveyard. 
- {The Tricky} is also a nice generic Monster with 2000 ATK and may see play before {Cyber Dragon} is released in Duel Links.

**[MiguelJoker](/top-player-council/migueljoker/)** says:
- Spellbooks and {Treacherous Trap Hole}.

**[SelectMaple](/top-player-council/selectmaple/)** says:
- {The Tricky} has a nice 2000 ATK and can Special Summon itself at the cost of one card. It can work with cards such as {Treeborn Frog} and {The Fabled Ganashia}. It potentially be in a Monarch Deck.
- {Tribute Burial} is a good card that can banish cards from your opponents Graveyard such as {Rose Lover}, {Destiny HERO - Celestial} and {Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror}.

**[Kaki](/top-player-council/kaki/)** says:
- {Dragon Ice} will be good with [Mermails](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Mermail) if they are released someday.

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- {White Night Dragon} will boost Dragon Decks but it doesn't work against {Sea Stealth Attack}.
- {Tribute Burial} allows you to banish one card per Graveyard, this has a lot of utility in various Decks. [Red-Eyes Zombies](/tier-list/deck-types/red-eyes-zombies/) being one and {Black Luster Soldier - Sacred Soldier} being the other as it synergises by banishing! This could open some doors.

#### "Is there anything else you'd like to say?"

<br>

**[Kaki](/top-player-council/kaki/)** says:
- You should get {Treacherous Trap Hole} it's a really good staple, the rest are not needed.

**[3K All Day](/top-player-council/3kallday/)** says:
- I'm planning to clear this box twice and with the sales I would like three copies of {Tribute Burial}, {Blizzard Princess}, {Treacherous Trap Hole} and the Spellbooks.
