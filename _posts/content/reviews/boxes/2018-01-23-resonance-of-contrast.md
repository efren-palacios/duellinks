- Future Potential: May be used in the future

#### New Deck Types

| TPC Member | Review |
| :------- | :---- |
| UnGatoPardo | I do not see a future deck type in this box. |
| [superforms](/authors/superforms) | Bujins. Best cards: {Bujin Yamato}, {Bujin Arasuda}, {Bujin Centipede}. Also new support for Black Luster Solider decks in {Dawn Knight}. | 
| Kaito | {Red-Eyes Slash Dragon} |
| Itsyoboyeden | New form of REZ, perhaps some other variants of Zombies |
| Whybona | None. |
| [Kazin_X](/authors/kazin-x) | Stall decks with {Defense Draw}, Harpies with {Phalanx Pike}, {No Mortal Can Resist} {Phalanx Pike}, {Crashbug Road} with Six Samurai, Red Eyes Ritual Deck with {Paladin of Dark Dragon} ({Red Eyes Impact}) or {Red-Eyes Slash Dragon} with BLS, {Zombie World} {Paladin of Cursed Dragon} |
| Nix | Bujin. But this box does not seem good to me, I'll be skipping it. |
| [Kayoh](/authors/Kayoh) | No new deck types. I don't believe this box will change the meta. |

#### Essential

| TPC Member | Review |
| :------- | :---- |
| UnGatoPardo | {Defense Draw} will be a staple in mill/burn decks. {Snipe Hunter} will also be a great addition to fiend decks. |
| [superforms](/authors/superforms) | None. |
| Kaito | None. |
| Itsyoboyeden | None. |
| [Kazin_X](/authors/kazin-x) | {Void Trap Hole} |
| Nix | None. |
| Whybona | None. |
| [Kayoh](/authors/Kayoh) | {Defense Draw} saves your LP and replaces itself, I can see this be played in cancer decks like burn/mill. |

#### Maybe

| TPC Member | Review |
| :------- | :---- |
| UnGatoPardo | {Phalanx Pike} could see use in standard Beatdown decks, potentially being able to be able to boost monsters by 1800 is very viable. |
| [superforms](/authors/superforms) | {Void Trap Hole} may be a popular side-deck card (against REZ and CA), and {Phalanx Pike} may be a REZ side-deck card for the mirror. {Trial and Tribulation} could be used in CA. |
| Kaito | {Red-Eyes Slash Dragon}: On a similar powerlevel than {Dark Paladin} but it has more potential as you all now we have a lot of good red eyes support. {Defense Draw}: Decent stall card that might see play in one of the new stall decks that showed up recently. Has the big disadvantage that it cannot be chained to backrow removal. |
| Itsyoboyeden | {Void Trap Hole}, {Defense Draw}, {Skill Successor} |
| [Kazin_X](/authors/kazinx) | {Snipe Hunter}: Fiend Decks or Control type decks (like {No Mortal Can Resist} control or Wallet Control), {Phalanx Pike}: Mirror matches or new deck types, {Skill Successor} , {Defense Draw} - any stall decks, can be interesting combination with GB under like a {Half Shut} or {Impenetrable Attack}, {Dawn Knight} with combination of {Beginning of Heaven and Earth}. You will select {Destiny HERO - Dasher}, {Black Luster Soldier - Sacred Soldier}, and {Dawn Knight}. Dawn knight can flip the BLS-SS to the top, then Dasher will summon it next turn you draw, {Trial and Tribulation}: Maybe for any ritual decks. CA still has some potential. And it can also be used in Monarchs to generate some fuel. But its a win-more card in most cases, {Photon Lead}: Quite a few good level 4 monsters. Quick effect. Goes with sacred crane to draw cards. You can pull on Zanji for six sam. Sasuke/Golden Upstart for Ninja (not sure if there is space). {Guardian of Felgrand} and then summon another monster to use felgrand effect, Crashbug Road - not bad if your opponent doesn't have another level 4 to summon. Good in six sam |
| Nix | {Paladin of the Cursed Dragon} in REZ |
| Whybona | {Skill Successor} as a potential side tech for {Straight to the Grave} REZ to help in the mirror match, especially against REZ decks using {The Ties That Bind}. {Snipe Hunter} as a tech in Volcanics for further removal. |
| [Kayoh](/authors/Kayoh) | {Skill Successor} could be a good side deck card for the REZ mirror |

#### Future Potential

| TPC Member | Review |
| :------- | :---- |
| UnGatoPardo | {Void Trap Hole} will see play as more archetypes revolving summoning big monsters such as {Cyber Angel Dakini} see play. Until then, this card might just be a side deck tech.|
| [Superforms](/authors/superforms) | {Dawn Knight}, potentially. |
| Kaito | Void Trap Hole is meant to be a sidedeck card against red eyes zombie. good players can play around it though by chaining spirit in chainlink 2 or higher. you don't need 3 of this right now. {Paladin of the Cursed Dragon} has the potential to be sided against Red Eyes Zombie.|
| Itsyoboyeden | Dawn Knight (for Lightsworn), {Phalanx Pike}, {Royal Command} (side deck), {Dark Dragon Ritual} & {Paladin of Dark Dragon} |
| [Kazin_X](/authors/kazinx) | Dawn Knight future potential for Lightsworn as well, {Photon Lead} for Lightsworn or if something like {Thunder King} comes to Duel Links |
| Nix | Royal Command can be a good side deck card. |
| Whybona | Void Trap Hole, Royal Command (future side deck card) |
| [Kayoh](/authors/Kayoh) | Void Trap Hole as a side deck card |
