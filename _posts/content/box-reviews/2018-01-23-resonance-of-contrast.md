### New Deck Types:

| TPC member | Review |
| :------- | :---- |
| UnGatoPardo | I did not see a future deck type in this box. |
| [superforms](/authors/superforms) | Bujins. Best cards: Yamato, Arasuda, Centipede. (Also new support for Black Luster Solider decks in Dawn Knight.) | 
| Kaito | Red Eyes Fusion |
| Itsyoboyeden | New form of REZ, perhaps some other variants of Zombies |
| Whybona | None. |
| [Kazin_X](/authors/kazin-x) | Stall decks with defense draw, Harpies with Phalanix Pike, No Mortal Can Resist Phalanix, Crashbug Road with Six Samurai, Red Eyes Ritual Deck with Paladin of Dark Dragon (Red Eyes Impact) or Red Eyes Slash Fusion with BLS, Zombie World Paladin of Cursed Dragon |
| Nix | Bujingi, but this box does not seem good to me. I will be skipping it. |
| [Kayoh](/authors/Kayoh) | No new deck types. I don't believe this box will change the meta. |

### Needed:

| TPC member | Review |
| :------- | :---- |
| UnGatoPardo | Defense draw will be a staple in mill/burn decks. Snipe hunter will also be a great addition to fiend decks. |
| [superforms](/authors/superforms) | None. |
| Kaito | None. |
| Itsyoboyeden | None. |
| [Kazin_X](/authors/kazin-x) | Void Trap Hole |
| Nix | None. |
| Whybona | None. |
| [Kayoh](/authors/Kayoh) | Defense draw saves your LP and replaces itself, I can see this be played in cancer decks like burn/mill. |

### Maybe

| TPC member | Review |
| :------- | :---- |
| UnGatoPardo | Phalanx spike could see use in standard Beatdown decks, potentially being able to be able to boost monsters by 1800 is very viable. |
| [superforms](/authors/superforms) | Void Trap Hole may be a popular side-deck card (against REZ and CA), and Phalanx Pike might be a REZ side-deck card for the mirror. Trial and Tribulation could be used in CA. |
| Kaito | Red-Eyes Slash Dragon: On a similar powerlevel than dark paladin but it has more potential as you all now we have a lot of good red eyes support. Defense Draw: Decent stall card that might see play in one of the new stall decks that showed up recently. Has the big disadvantage that it cannot be chained to backrow removal. |
| Itsyoboyeden | Void Trap Hole, Defense Draw, Skill Successor |
| [Kazin_X](/authors/kazinx) | Snipe Hunter - Fiend Decks or Control type decks (like NMCR control or Wallet Control), Phalanix Pike - Mirror Matches or new deck types, Skill successor , Defense Draw - any stall decks, can be interesting combination with GB under like a half shut or IA, Dawn Knight with combination of beginning of heaven. You will select dasher, BLS-SS, and Dawn Knight...dawn knight can flip the BLS-SS to the top, then dasher will summon it next turn you draw, Trial and Tribulation - Maybe for any ritual decks. CA still has some potential. And it can also be used in monarchs to generate some fuel. But its a win-more card in most cases, Photon Lead - quite a few good level 4s. Quick effect. Goes with sacred crane to draw cards. You can pull on Zanji for six sam. Sasuke/Golden Upstart for Ninja (not sure if there is space). Guardian of Felgrand and then summon another monster to use felgrand effect, Crashbug Road - not bad if your opponent doesn't have another level 4 to summon. Good in six sam |
| Nix | Paladin of the Cursed Dragon in REZ |
| Whybona | Skill Successor as a potential side tech for Straight to the Grave REZ to help in the mirror match, especially against REZ decks using The Ties That Bind. Snipe Hunter as a tech in Volcanics for further removal. |
| [Kayoh](/authors/Kayoh) | Skill successor could be a good side deck card for the REZ mirror |

### Future Potential

| TPC member | Review |
| UnGatoPardo | Void Trap Hole will see play as more archetypes revolving summoning big monsters such as Dakini see play. Until then, this card might just be a side deck tech.|
| [superforms](/authors/superforms) | Dawn Knight, potentially. |
| Kaito | Void Trap Hole is meant to be a sidedeck card against red eyes zombie. good players can play around it though by chaining spirit in chainlink 2 or higher. you don't need 3 of this right now. Paladin of the Cursed Dragon.  Paladin of the cursed Dragon: Has the potential to be sided against Red Eyes Zombie.|
| Itsyoboyeden | Dawn Knight (for Lightsworn), Phalanx Pike, Royal Command (side deck), Dark Dragon Ritual & Paladin of Dark Dragon |
| [Kazin_X](/authors/kazinx) | Dawn Knight future potential for Lightsworn as well, Photon Lead for Lightsworn or if something like Thunder King comes to Duel Links |
| Nix | Royal Command can be a good side deck card. |
| Whybona | Void Trap Hole, Royal Command (future side deck card) |
| [Kayoh](/authors/Kayoh) | Void Trap Hole as a side deck card |
