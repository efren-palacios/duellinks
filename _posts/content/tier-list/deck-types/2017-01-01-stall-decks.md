### Overview
The deck is self-explanatory. The idea is to delay the game as long as you can through creature removal and heavy backrow control. The current version uses {Endless Trap Hell} to refuel resources and drag the games into the final stages, making sure your opponent runs out of cards first.

### Sample Deck

[deck:Endless Trap Hell](Man-Eater Bug; Man-Eater Bug; Yomi Ship; Yomi Ship; Yomi Ship; D.D. Warrior; D.D. Warrior; Burning Land; Floodgate Trap Hole; Floodgate Trap Hole; Floodgate Trap Hole; Divine Wrath; Wall of Disruption; Wall of Disruption; Wall of Disruption; Windstorm of Etaqua; Curse of Anubis; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Massivemorph)  

### Core Cards

[deck](Man-Eater Bug; Yomi Ship; D.D. Warrior; Burning Land; Floodgate Trap Hole; Floodgate Trap Hole; Floodgate Trap Hole; Wall of Disruption; Windstorm of Etaqua; Curse of Anubis; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Massivemorph)

Cards required to start playing the deck effectively. The numbers you include for each one will depend on your card collection.

### Tech Cards

[deck](Sphere Kuriboh; 4-Starred Ladybug of Doom; Golden Ladybug; Divine Wrath; Draining Shield; Eliminating the League; Aegis of Gaia)

These are good cards to fill the empty spaces on your deck.

### Extra Info

- Be patient, the deck doesn't have a fast win condition. Don't pull the trigger on your skill too fast, remember you can use it only 1 time per duel. Don't be afraid to force your opponent's backrow attacking with monsters like D.D Warrior, his banish effect can be used for both offense and defense.
