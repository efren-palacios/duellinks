### Overview
Snipe Hunter is a control deck that evolved/shares a lot of similarities with Wallet Control and Volcanics. The goal of the deck is to achieve complete board control through the aid of {Snipe Hunter}, {Sergeant Electro}, and {Blaze Accelerator} (if you run the Volcanic Shell version).

The biggest difference between Snipe Hunter and Wallet Control/Volcanics is that Snipe Hunter fills the role of Sergeant Electro and Blaze Accelerator, as well as other key cards in Wallet Control/Volcanics, with the small price of a 33% chance to fail.

### Sample Deck

[deck:Switcheroo](Volcanic Rocket; Volcanic Rocket; Volcanic Rocket; Volcanic Shell; Volcanic Shell; Volcanic Shell; Snipe Hunter; Snipe Hunter; Snipe Hunter; Sergeant Electro; Sergeant Electro; Sergeant Electro; Blaze Accelerator; Floodgate Trap Hole; Floodgate Trap Hole; Mirror Wall; Mirror Wall; Mirror Wall; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller)

Decklist by Tutpup. Between {Floodgate Trap Hole} and {Enemy Controller} it makes the Cyber Angels matchup better than the version I ran in MCS, but it has less general protection. However, the Enemy Controllers deal with the majority of the tier 1-3 decks as well as the {Sphere Kuriboh} / {Curse of Anubis} do that I ran before.

### Core Cards

[deck](Snipe Hunter; Snipe Hunter; Volcanic Shell; Volcanic Shell; Volcanic Shell; Volcanic Rocket; Volcanic Rocket; Volcanic Rocket; Sergeant Electro; Sergeant Electro; Sergeant Electro; Blaze Accelerator; Mirror Wall; Mirror Wall)

### Tech Cards

[deck](Enemy Controller; Floodgate Trap Hole; Curse of Anubis; The Regulation of Tribe; Sphere Kuriboh)

All of these cards are optional but excellent additions.

### Extra Info

- {Snipe Hunter} isn't 'meant' to win the dice roll as often as it's 'meant' to force chainable backrow such as {Enemy Controller} and {Red-Eyes Spirit}.

- You can use the combination of {Volcanic Shell} + {Switcheroo} to go +1.

- Generally you want to keep Snipe Hunter in hand until you have some sort of board control with either backrow and/or {Sergeant Electro}.
