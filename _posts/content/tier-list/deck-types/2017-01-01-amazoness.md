#### Updated May 4, 2018 
##### All New Decktype Information 

### Overview

The Amazoness archetype received new support in {Amazoness Princess} with the [Elegant Mai event](/events/may-2018/elegant-mai/) which has made it a top tier competitor for tournament play and the ladder. The Deck revolves around Amazoness Princess to search for {Amazoness Onsalught} and swarm the field with Amazoness Monsters. Princess added a much need consistency boost to the Deck and her Special Summoning ability allows you to toolbox your Deck in order to search for the Monster you need for a given situation. The Deck can create a very difficult to deal with board; with only one Amazoness Princess you can set Onslaught and Special Summon {Amazoness Queen} from the Deck. {Amazoness Baby Tiger} adds to the incredible swarming and recovery potential of the Deck. Meanwhile, {Amazoness Onslaught} allows you to banish any Monster your Amazoness Monsters battle with. This is very powerful since it banishes cards like {Rose Lover}, {Destiny HERO - Celestial}, {Archfiend Empress} and {World Carrotweight Champion} stopping them from using their powerful Graveyard effects while also reducing the usefulness of cards like {Powerful Rebirth}.

### Sample Deck
Nel won [Meta Weekly #18](/tournaments/meta-weekly/18/report/) with this fairly standard Amazoness build.

### Extra Information
- When you Normal Summon {Amazoness Princess} while you have a {Amazoness Baby Tiger} in your hand; if you are going first Special Summon the Tiger with its effect. When going second, if you will attack with Princess you can keep the Tiger in your hand to use as Princess' cost. This essentially means you get a free search since you can Special Summon the Tiger from your Graveyard when Princess Summons her follower.
- The recurring nature of {Amazoness Baby Tiger} allows you to abuse the second effect of {Enemy Controller} without a loss of card advantage. 
- It is often better to Special Summon in the Battle Phase rather than Normal Summon to get the ATK boost. This Special Summon can also occur on your opponents turn so you can Special Summon a Monster to protect your LP. 
- The above Deck core omits {Powerful Rebirth} and {Amazoness Willpower} as core cards. However, you should be running any combination of two copies of these cards. Willpower has the benefit of been searchable by {Amazoness Princess} and reviving {Amazoness Queen}. However, the Trap is tied to its target and the Monster can be nullified by putting it in Defence position. The advantage with {Powerful Rebirth} is that it is not tied to a Monster so you can send it to the Graveyard for Princess' cost but it cannot revive Queen.
- The Deck has a huge range of tech card potential as seen above. The most commonly used tech cards are {Amazoness Sage}, {Cosmic Cyclone}, {Forbidden Chalice}, {Enemy Controller} and {Amazoness Willpower}. 
- This Deck has positive matchups against: [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/), Spellbooks, [Aliens](/tier-list/deck-types/aliens/) and [Cyber Angels](/tier-list/deck-types/cyber-angels/).
- This Deck has an even matchup against: [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/).
- This Deck has a bad match against: [Archfiends](/tier-list/deck-types/archfiends/) and [Gearigias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/).
