### Overview
{Dark Magician} is everyone's favourite and most nostalgic card from the anime! And the newest addition to Duel Links, Arkana, has made this an actual viable deck in game, placing it under Notable Kog Decks. As much as I'd hate to say it, Dark Magician is not a strong tournament deck. But it still has the power to annihilate top tier decks and it has already been proven to be a King of Games deck.

### Sample Deck

[deck:Master of Magicians](Sergeant Electro;Sergeant Electro;Sergeant Electro;Legion the Fiend Jester;Legion the Fiend Jester;Magician's Rod;Magician's Rod;Dark Magician;Dark Magician;Dark Magician;Dark Magic Attack;Enemy Controller;Enemy Controller;Dark Magic Curtain;Ancient Rules;Ancient Rules;Thousand Knives;Mirror Wall;Mirror Wall;Champion's Vigilance)

With the addition of {Dark Magic Curtain}, it is now a lot easier to get a Dark Magician on the field, meaning the OP Dark Magician spells {Dark Magic Attack} and {Thousand Knives} will see a lot of use. Complete backrow destruction is this deck's strongest combo, along with monster removal, giving you huge advantage and allowing you to safely swing with your monsters. All of the mentioned spells are searchable with x2 {Magician's Rod}, giving you options to grab the best card for the situation.

Note: You cannot activate {Dark Magic Curtain} the turn you summoned a monster. Or you can not summon a monster the turn you used {Dark Magic Curtain}. However, you can set, which you should in most cases to avoid your opponent doing Econ take plays.      

### Core Cards

[deck](Sergeant Electro;Sergeant Electro;Legion the Fiend Jester;Legion the Fiend Jester;Magician's Rod;Magician's Rod;Dark Magician;Dark Magician;Dark Magician;Dark Magic Attack;Dark Magic Curtain;Ancient Rules;Ancient Rules;Thousand Knives;Champion's Vigilance)

Since you're only limited to 1 {Dark Magic Attack}, {Sergeant Electro} is necessary to take care of backrow. Itâ€™s also good to force out your opponent's {Floodgate Traphole}s, since it would be devastating on your Dark Magician. If you're in control of the game, be patient and try to bait out floodgates before going all in with your Dark Magician.

{Legion the Fiend Jester} is also necessary as they search for Dark Magician (combo'd with {Ancient Rules}) and make tribute summons easier given the opportunity.

{Champion's Vigilance} is limited for a reason, it's really strong, especially with negating your opponent's monster summon. Since summoning Dark Magician is fast and easy, you'll always have use for this card.           

### Tech Cards

[deck](Enemy controller;Mirror Wall;Floodgate Trap Hole;Curse of Anubis;Super Rush Headlong;Wall of Disruption)

All of these cards are great additions to the deck but optional.

### Extra Info

- If you have yet to use your {Dark Magic Curtain}, make sure to leave at least 1 Dark Magician in your deck. Remember, Jesters can grab Dark Magician from the Graveyard.

- {Magician's Rod} 's secondary effect that adds itself back from the GY to your hand does come in handy sometimes, especially if you have a floodgated monster that you don't mind tributing. It's search is powerful, and you have to be aware of what you have left to search in your deck. Remember, you must activate a spell/trap in your opponent's turn, so think carefully whether or not having the searcher is worth it.
