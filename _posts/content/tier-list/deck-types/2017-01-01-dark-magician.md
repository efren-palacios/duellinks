#### Updated May 4, 2018 
##### Overview Updated

### Overview
{Dark Magician} is everyone's favourite and most nostalgic card from the anime! And the newest addition to Duel Links, Arkana, has made this an actual viable deck in game, placing it under Notable Kog Decks. As much as I'd hate to say it, Dark Magician is not a strong tournament deck. But it still has the power to annihilate top tier decks and it has already been proven to be a King of Games deck.

### Extra Info

- If you have yet to use your {Dark Magic Curtain}, make sure to leave at least 1 Dark Magician in your deck. Remember, Jesters can grab Dark Magician from the Graveyard.

- {Magician's Rod} 's secondary effect that adds itself back from the GY to your hand does come in handy sometimes, especially if you have a floodgated monster that you don't mind tributing. It's search is powerful, and you have to be aware of what you have left to search in your deck. Remember, you must activate a spell/trap in your opponent's turn, so think carefully whether or not having the searcher is worth it.
