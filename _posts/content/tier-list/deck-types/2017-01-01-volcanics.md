#### Updated May 4, 2018 
##### Sample Deck Updated

### Overview
Volcanics is an archetype which focuses on constant monster removal through the use of {Blaze Accelerator} and {Tri-Blaze Accelerator}. It uses {Volcanic Rocket} to search for these cards, {Volcanic Shell} as discard fodder and {Royal Firestorm Guards} in order to recycle the Volcanic Shells and out resource the opponent. It is played as a control based deck which slowly grinds out the opponent's monsters and attacks the opponent directly when the field is cleared, slowly chipping away at their life points.

### Extra Info

- Remember that you can set shells if you lack other monsters; if your opponent destroys it then you will still be able to use its effect.

- When using firestorm guards to shuffle pyro monsters back into your deck, leaving at least one shell in the graveyard is a good play as it will allow you to activate its effect and thin.

- Volcanic's hardest matchups are Red-Eyes Zombies and Hazy Flame. However, this deck has a wide variety of tech options that can make at least 1 of the two matchups favorable, but leaves the other difficult. Choose your tech cards to best counter the deck that you believe will be the most common, and use your side deck (if you have one) to cover the other.
