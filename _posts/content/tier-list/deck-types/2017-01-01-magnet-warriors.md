#### Updated May 4, 2018 
##### Overview and Sample Deck Updated

### Overview
Magnet Warriors is an archetype that focuses on milling your rock monsters to the graveyard with the use of {Delta the Magnet Warrior} and {Beta the Electromagnet Warrior}. By doing so, you set-up your special summons and quickly draw into your big plays. With the easy special summon capabilities of {Gaia Plate the Earth Giant} and {Valkyrion the Magna Warrior}, this deck can easily defeat your opponent in one turn or disrupt their entire field.

### Extra Info

* When activating {Beta the Electromagnet Warrior}'s first effect, keep track of how many {Delta the Magnet Warrior}s are left in your deck as you donâ€™t want to be forced to add a {Beta the Magnet Warrior} to your hand. You want Beta the Magnet Warrior in your graveyard, not your hand.   
* Try to save Beta the Electromagnet Warrior's second effect until your opponent's end phase, that way you can prevent any targeting effects on it during your opponent's turn.  

* Before sending Delta the Magnet Warrior to your graveyard to special summon {Valkyrion the Magna Warrior}, check to see if you have the correct monsters in the graveyard first (3 Magnet Warriors but none can be Delta the Magnet Warrior).  

* When special summoning {Gaia Plate the Earth Giant} before Valkyrion the Magna Warrior, try to banish Delta the Magnet Warriors from your graveyard as fuel for Gaia Plate the Earth Giant because if you banish 2 of the 4 possible monsters needed for Valkyrion (1 Electromagnet and 3 Beta), then he becomes a dead card.
