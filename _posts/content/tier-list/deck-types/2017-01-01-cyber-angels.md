### Change Log
March 27th, 2018 - Sample deck updated.

### Overview
Cyber Angels is a ritual deck that finds wins through controlling the board and overwhelming the opponent through resource management. The deck has traditionally been considered an OTK deck, but thanks to the addition of {Saffira, Queen of Dragons}, CA is capable of fostering different playstyles while retaining OTK potential. Your approach with cyber angels is to summon you boss monsters early and use them to generate advantage by drawing from the deck and recycling from your grave. If your opponent cannot win the lottery on which cards they need to shut down your Saffira and {Cyber Angel Dakini} early or are incapable of getting an OTK, victory is all but assured.

### Sample Deck

[deck:Balance](Saffira, Queen of Dragons; Saffira, Queen of Dragons; Saffira, Queen of Dragons; Cyber Angel Dakini; Cyber Angel Idaten; Cyber Angel Benten; Cyber Angel Benten; Cyber Angel Benten; Senju of the Thousand Hands; Senju of the Thousand Hands; Senju of the Thousand Hands; Cyber Petit Angel; Cyber Petit Angel; Hey, Trunade!; Hey, Trunade!; Hey, Trunade!; Machine Angel Ritual; Machine Angel Absolute Ritual; Hymn of Light; Hymn of Light; Sprite's Blessing)

5th place deck by Luis.

### Core Cards

[deck](Saffira, Queen of Dragons; Saffira, Queen of Dragons; Cyber Angel Dakini; Cyber Angel Benten; Cyber Angel Benten; Cyber Angel Benten; Senju of the Thousand Hands; Senju of the Thousand Hands; Cyber Petit Angel; Cyber Petit Angel; Machine Angel Absolute Ritual; Hymn of Light; Hymn of Light; Sprite's Blessing)

These are the minimum requirements to start playing the deck effectively.   

### Tech Cards

[deck](Bacon Saver; Forbidden Chalice; Enemy Controller; Wall of Disruption; Curse of Anubis; Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress; Fenghuang; Greenkappa; Cosmic Cyclone; Double Cyclone; Fire Formation - Gyokkou)

While these cards can help in multiple matchups, they do not feed into CA's main objective of summonin boss monsters and gaining advantage. Use these cards in moderation or in your side deck.
