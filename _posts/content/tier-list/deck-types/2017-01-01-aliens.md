### Overview
Aliens is a deck that uses A-Counters: These counters are used to activate card effects from monsters, traps and spells. Some Aliens are able to use A-counters to reduce enemy monsters attack and defense, and will have the text "If a monster with an A-Counter battles an Alien monster, it loses 300 ATK and DEF for each A-Counter during damage calculation only." This effect stacks for each Alien monster on the field. Aliens have been labeled as the best free-to-play and new player friendly deck in Duel Links with only one core Super Rare card. Alien decks are extremely versitile and have room for situational tech cards, making them a strong deck for experienced players as well.

### Sample Deck

[deck:Balance](Alien Overlord;Alien Telepath;Alien Telepath;Alien Telepath;Alien Warrior;Alien Warrior;Alien Warrior;Alien Grey;"A" Cell Recombination Device;"A" Cell Recombination Device;"A" Cell Recombination Device;Enemy Controller;Enemy Controller;Enemy Controller;Powerful Rebirth;Powerful Rebirth;Brainwashing Beam;Brainwashing Beam;Curse of Anubis;Wall of Disruption)

Meta Weekly 9 winning Alien deck.     

### Core Cards

[deck](Alien Overlord;Alien Telepath;Alien Telepath;Alien Telepath;Alien Warrior;Alien Warrior;Alien Warrior;Brainwashing Beam;Brainwashing Beam)

These are the cards you shouldn't play the deck without.         

### Tech Cards

[deck](Powerful Rebirth;Enemy Controller;Evil Dragon Ananta;Cosmic Cyclone;Sphere Kuriboh;Crop circles;Anti-Magic Arrows;Mysterious Triangle)

All of these cards are great additions to the deck but optional.

### Extra Info

- Aliens A-counter -300 effect stacks, so: 2 aliens (with the text effect) = -600 with 1 counter.

- {Alien Shocktrooper} benefits from the A-counter stat reduction as long as you have another alien on the field, but does not grant that benefit itself as it lacks the required text effect.

- Play {"A" Cell Recombination Device} on the end phase of your opponent’s turn, this way you can get the effect of adding an alien monster to your hand on your following turn.

- In some situations, using {\"A\" Cell Recombination Device} to lower an attacking monster’s ATK is a viable play. You lose valuable A-counters when their monster is destroyed, but destroying a monster in their battle phase can generate advantage.
