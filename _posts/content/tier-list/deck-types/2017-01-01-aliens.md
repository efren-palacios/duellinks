#### Updated May 5, 2018 
##### Tech Cards Updated

### Overview
Aliens is a deck that uses A-Counters: These counters are used to activate card effects from monsters, traps and spells. Some Aliens are able to use A-counters to reduce enemy monsters attack and defense, and will have the text "If a monster with an A-Counter battles an Alien monster, it loses 300 ATK and DEF for each A-Counter during damage calculation only." Alien decks are extremely versitile and have room for situational tech cards, making them a strong deck for experienced players as well.

### Extra Info

* Aliens A-counter -300 effect stacks, so: 2 aliens (with the text effect) = -600 with 1 counter.

* Play {\"A\" Cell Recombination Device} on the end phase of your opponentâ€™s turn, this way you can get the effect of adding an alien monster to your hand on your following turn.

* Alien Kids effect to place an A-counter cannot be negated by {Divine Wrath}.  

* Econ taking an enemys Alien Overlord will destroy theirs and keep yours in tact if you have one on the field.
