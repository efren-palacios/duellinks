### Overview
Red-Eyes Zombies is a top tier deck because it is one of the most versatile decks in the game since the day it came out. Red-Eyes Zombies can keep it's core cards and tech-in certain cards to adapt to the meta as it evolves. The decks main engine revolves around {Gozuki}, the most important card of the deck next to {Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon}. The deck can be played two ways: as an agressive OTK (One Turn Kill) deck or a semi-agressive control deck depending on the tech cards you run. For example, a Red-Eyes Zombies deck that has only anti-backrow, 3 {Enemy Controller}s and it's core cards is built for an OTK. The Red-Eyes Zombies decks that run {Wall of Disruption}, {Mirror Wall}s, {Snipe Hunter} and other techs play more like a control deck. Both versions of this deck dominate in competitive tournaments as well as the Duel Links Ranked ladder. The biggest drawback of this deck is it's ability to start you off with completely unplayable hands. This doesn't happen often but happens enough to make Red-Eyes Zombies players pull the hair out of their heads.

### Sample Deck

[deck:Beatdown](Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon; Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon; Gozuki; Gozuki; Gozuki; Samurai Skull; Samurai Skull; Bacon Saver; Red-Eyes Insight; Red-Eyes Insight; Cosmic Cyclone; Storm; Storm; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Red-Eyes Spirit; Red-Eyes Spirit; Wall of Disruption; Wall of Disruption) 

### Core Cards

[deck](Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon; Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon; Gozuki; Gozuki; Bacon Saver; Samurai Skull; Samurai Skull; Red-Eyes Insight; Red-Eyes Insight; Red-Eyes Spirit; Red-Eyes Spirit)

These are the cards you shouldn't play the deck without.

For every {Gozuki} you're missing, replace with {Samurai Skull}    

### Tech Cards

[deck](Enemy Controller; Mirror Wall; Super Rush Headlong; Curse of Anubis; Windstorm of Etaqua; Wall of Disruption)

All of these cards are great additions of the deck but optional.

### Extra Info

- To avoid a {Floodgate Trap Hole}, activate your {Red-Eyes Spirit} on chainlink 2 or higher.

- In the mirror match save your {Bacon Saver} and other protective backrow to protect your {Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon} unless you absolutely have to use it to save your level 4 monsters.

- Always use {Cosmic Cyclone} on the {Umi} / {A Legendary Ocean} field spell during your turn or in their battle phase so they cannot put another one out. Use Cosmic Cyclone on the field spell over {Sea Stealth Attack} because the trap is dead without Umi and clogs their backrow.

- Against Aliens, set monsters with {Wall of Disruption} so they cannot put A-Counters on your faceup monsters. They will always flood the field with Aliens so Wall of Disruption is your best friend in this match up. If they get A-Counters on your monsters, "E-con take" their Aliens to throw away your monster with the A-Counters.
