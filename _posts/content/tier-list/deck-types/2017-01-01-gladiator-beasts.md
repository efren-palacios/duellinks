### Overview
Gladiator Beasts are one the few decks which were tier one in the trading card game which have been introduced to Duel Links with a competitive core. The general strategy of the deck is to use your Gladiator Beast monsters in battle. This will allow you to return that Gladiator to the deck to special summon another with a different name. This mechanic is commonly referred to as “tagging out” and this is how it will be named on this page and the guide. When a Gladiator Beast is tagged in, that monster gains an effect. For example, {Gladiator Beast Bestiari} will allow you to destroy any spell of trap card on the field when tagged in. Meanwhile, {Gladiator Beast Murmillo} will let you destroy a monster. These tagging effects mean the deck can deal with almost any board state and generate card advantage every turn. Gladiator Beasts also have three fusion monsters which you can “tag in” buy returning their fusion material monsters from the field back to the deck without using cards like {Polymerisation}. This gives the deck access to powerful boss monsters and gives the deck extra utility. Gladiator Beasts have been the go to control deck in Duel Links for some time.

The strength of the deck is its versatility. The core of the deck is between seven and eight monsters. This gives the deck between twelve and thirteen tech spots which you can customize to have favorable match-ups against a specific group of decks. Additionally, there is a huge number of skills which the deck can make use of; {Balance} remains the most popular skill but players have had success with {Mind Scan}, {Shadow Game}, {No Mortal Can Resist} and {Three-Star Demotion} to name but a few. While the diversity of the metagame has hindered the Gladiator Beast archetype over the last month, the deck can definitely still compete in a tournament format where the side deck can be built to beat decks which the main is weak against. It is also a good option for “team war” formats where you can build to counter one specific deck and remain versatile enough for the decks which follow after that.

### Sample Deck
This deck was used by both BBDz and SilchasRuin to achieve top 16 finishes at [MCSVI](/tournaments/meta-championship-series/6/report/). It is worth pointing that both players’ side decks were similar. Both had two copies of {Cosmic Cyclone} and at least one {Wall of Disruption} in their side decks. SilchasRuin also sided {Disappear} while BBDz sided {Foolish Return}. It is not a coincidence that both top 16 builds were identical and had similar side decks. This was likely the optimal Gladiator Beast deck before [Rampage of the Forest](/box-reviews/rampage-of-the-forest/) released.

[deck:Balance](Gladiator Beast Laquari; Gladiator Beast Laquari; Gladiator Beast Laquari; Gladiator Beast Bestiari; Gladiator Beast Bestiari; Gladiator Beast Murmillo; Gladiator Beast Murmillo; Gladiator Beast Dimacari; Super Rush Headlong; Super Rush Headlong; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Floodgate Trap Hole; Floodgate Trap Hole; Floodgate Trap Hole; Impenetrable Attack; Impenetrable Attack; Curse of Anubis; Windstorm of Etaqua)

### Core Cards

[deck](Gladiator Beast Laquari; Gladiator Beast Laquari; Gladiator Beast Laquari; Gladiator Beast Bestiari; Gladiator Beast Bestiari; Gladiator Beast Murmillo; Gladiator Beast Murmillo; Gladiator Beast Dimacari; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller)  

[deck](Gladiator Beast Heraklinos; Gladiator Beast Nerokius; Gladiator Beast Essedarii)

The only core cards to the Gladiator Beast deck is its monsters and extra deck. Most builds use 3x {Enemy Controller} since it does a lot for the deck. Your other spell and trap choices will be determined by the current metagame and which decks you aim to beat. It is important to look at recent tournament results and build your deck to beat the most popular decks.

### Tech Cards

[deck](Sphere Kuriboh; Half Shut; Sergeant Electro; D.D. Warrior; Cosmic Cyclone; Super Rush Headlong; Gravity Lash; Forbidden Chalice; Fire Formation - Gyokkou; Anti-Magic Arrows; Autonomous Action Unit; Curse of Anubis; Windstorm of Etaqua; Impenetrable Attack; Wall of Disruption; Mirror Wall; Xing Zhen Hu; Divine Wrath; Powerful Rebirth; Disappear; Memory Loss)

These cards are all excellent additions to your Gladiator Beast deck. Remember, when using {Balance} you will want to run 7-8 monsters. Without balance you will want to run 8-9 monsters (we do not count {Sphere Kuriboh} as a monster for non-balance builds). {Floodgate Trap Hole} is usually ran at 3 copies each. {Curse of Anubis} is typically also used. However, I do not consider these core cards as they can swapped for other cards if needed. I will not cover side deck cards here or explain why you want to use these card – If you wish to know why and how to use these and for side deck options please read the main guide below.

### Extra Info

- You have a way to never deck out with Gladiator Beasts. You can tag two monsters into the deck to summon {Gladiator Beast Essedarii}. This includes Essedarii himself. This means you can summon Gladiator Beast Essedarii every turn and return one Gladiator to the deck every turn. This is very useful for when you have locked down the opponent’s field with cards like {Floodgate Trap Hole} or {Wall of Disruption} or if you are against a stall deck. Always be aware of the option to win through deck-out in the late game.

- If you are using {Balance}, running 8 monsters, 6 spells and 6 traps will guarantee you a starting hand of 1 monster, 1 spell and 1 trap plus an extra random card. This is the best way to use balance but only if there are 6 spells and 6 traps you wish to use. Do not add useless spells or traps just to reach this ratio. Also consider this ratio when side decking.

- {Gladiator Beast Nerokius} stops any ignition effect and therefore gets through {Sea Stealth Attack} and {Des Counterblow}. It does not stop non-ignition based continuous effects such as {Mirror Wall} and {Toon Kingdom}. You can also use cards such as {Cosmic Cyclone} and {Enemy Controller} in the battle step when attacking with Gladiator Beast Nerokius so that the opponent will not be able to respond to it.

- {Gladiator Beast Heraklinos} can negate cards activated on his summon such as {Floodgate Trap Hole}. He can also negate in the damage step. He cannot negate counter traps. This is because Gladiator Beast Heraklinos is spell speed 2 while counter traps are spell speed 3.

- You can use {Super Rush Headlong} on a tagged-in {Gladiator Beast Dimacari} to destroy two monsters of the same attribute in one turn. This can be devastating against Hazy Flame and Sea Stealth Attack Decks.

- {Gladiator Beast Bestiari}'s and {Gladiator Beast Murmillo}'s tag-in effects are mandatory so only summon them if you can destroy a card your opponent controls. Take note of what Gladiators have been destroyed. If you have lost your Gladiator Beast Dimacari, you can only tag Laquari into Bestiari or Murmillo. Take care to not destroy your own cards.

- If you are using {Super Rush Headlong}, bear in mind that the turn player’s Super Rush Headlong will always activate first. Therefore, in your turn you can use your Super Rush Headlong in response to your opponent’s to destroy their monster and save your own. If you are doing this make sure you activate your Super Rush Headlong in the battle step to avoid {Sphere Kuriboh}.

- Always activate cards such as {Super Rush Headlong}, {Impenetrable Attack} and {Enemy Controller} in the battle step to avoid cards which only activate at attack declaration such as {Wall of Disruption} and {Sphere Kuriboh}.

- Always activate cards which can be used in the damage step such as {Mirror Wall} and {Gravity Lash} in the damage step.

- Against decks which use chainable cards which summon monsters from the grave, hand or deck (e.g. {Red-Eyes Spirit} and {Powerful Rebirth}) always tag in Bestiari to force the activation of that card and then Murmillo second to destroy the summoned monster.

- In the mirror match the turn player will ALWAYS be able to tag out their monster first. In some situations you may want to tag out second. You can try to pass this priority over to the opponent by pressing the back arrow on the first activation prompt or by turning toggle to off. A seasoned Gladiator Beasts player will know to pass this priority back but 90% of the time the play works. See the mirror match section of the guide to see when you will want to try this move.

- The second activation prompt is rarely used (The Yes or No window for Gladiator effects) but in some situations it will come up. You cannot control the tagging out order here. I have tested what determines the order and it is always in reverse summon order. For example, the Dimacari you summoned this turn will tag out before the Murmillo you summoned on the previous turn.

- In the mirror match you can use {Enemy Controller} to take control of an opponent’s Gladiator Beast which has already battled. This will allow you to return that Gladiator to the opponent’s deck and tag your own in. This is a huge tempo swing and can win you the mirror match. Make sure to toggle to on after battling to be able to steal your opponent’s Gladiator Beast in their turn. Use this "E-con take" play before ending the battle phase in your own turn to avoid your opponent making this play.

- Please read the match-up section of the Guide to learn how to play against certain match-ups and how best to use cards such as {Cosmic Cyclone}.
