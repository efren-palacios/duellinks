#### Updated May 4, 2018 
##### Overview and Extra Info Updated

### Overview
The general strategy of the deck is to use your Gladiator Beast monsters in battle. This will allow you to return that Gladiator to the deck to special summon another with a different name. The strength of the deck is its versatility.

### Extra Info

- You have a way to never deck out with Gladiator Beasts. You can tag two monsters into the deck to summon {Gladiator Beast Essedarii}. You can summon Gladiator Beast Essedarii every turn and return one Gladiator to the deck every turn.  

- If you are using {Balance}, running 8 monsters, 6 spells and 6 traps will guarantee you a starting hand of 1 monster, 1 spell and 1 trap plus an extra random card.  

- {Gladiator Beast Nerokius} stops any ignition effect and therefore gets through {Sea Stealth Attack} and {Des Counterblow}. 

- Always activate cards such as {Super Rush Headlong}, {Impenetrable Attack} and {Enemy Controller} in the battle step to avoid cards which only activate at attack declaration such as {Wall of Disruption} and {Sphere Kuriboh}.

- Always activate cards which can be used in the damage step such as {Mirror Wall} and {Gravity Lash} in the damage step.

- Against decks which use chainable cards which summon monsters from the grave, hand or deck (e.g. {Red-Eyes Spirit} and {Powerful Rebirth}) always tag in Bestiari to force the activation of that card and then Murmillo second to destroy the summoned monster.
