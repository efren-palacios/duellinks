#### Updated May 4, 2018 
##### Overview Updated

### Overview  

Masked Heroes is an archetype released in the Valiant Souls Main Box. While several Masked HERO monsters were released, Masked HERO Anki is by far the best based on his effect, stats and attribute. By sending a HERO monster you control to the graveyard, Mask Change allows you to special summon a Masked HERO monster with the same attribute from your extra deck. When Anki destroys a monster, he can search for any "Change" Quick-Play spell. This Quick-Play effect allows you to activate in the Battle Phase. Since Mask Change does not limit itself to once per turn, you can easily clear your opponents entire field of monsters in one turn effectively killing any momentum.

### Extra Info

* Activating Forbidden Chalice in the Damage Step of Masked HERO Ankis direct attack resets his attack to 3200.  

* Using Destiny HERO - Dangerous' effect in the End Phase of your opponents turn is a great way to set up for a Desiny HERO - Celestial draw effect the next turn.  

* Remember that level 6 and above monsters cannot target Destiny HERO - Decider for an attack. Simply summoning him can sometimes give you the time you need to draw into a Mask Change.  

* If you are using the fusion option build, do not feel obligated to say yes to Destiny HERO - Dreamers effect prompt the first time it appears. You may need it later to save a monster.
