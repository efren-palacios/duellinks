### Overview  

The Geargia deck revolves around Monsters which can flip themselves face-down and have very powerful non-targeting destruction effects when flipped face-up. Since all the Monsters are Machine type, the deck has access to a wide range of tech options. The most relevant being {Pulse Mines} which is arguably the strongest defensive backrow card in the game. The deck's strategy revolves around flipping your Monsters face-down and then flipping them face-up. {Geargiattacker} destroys Spell and Trap cards while {Geargianchor} destroys Monsters. Both of these cards do not target and instead you select cards to destroy at resolution. This means the opponent is forced to chain their backrow to our Monster effects before we select targets.

Because the effect counts the number of other Geargia Monsters at resolution you will need to have ways to build a field and protect your Monsters. Thankfully, we have numerous options to do that between {Ties of the Brethren}, {Powerful Rebirth} and the non-core Geargia Monsters to a lesser extent.

### Sample Deck  

ShinySopheon did an amazing job getting second place in [MCS VII](/tournaments/meta-championship-series/7/report/) with a {Restart} version of the deck which was built to abuse {Ties of the Brethren} to its fullest.

### Tech Cards  
The Ties build has four tech spots and the non-Ties build has six tech spots. Below these techs will be discussed in detail.

### Extra Info  

* Due to the wording of {Geargiattacker}, it can miss the timing to use its effect in situations where {Desert Sunlight} or {Ghostick Scare} is not chain-link one.  

* Monster placement after {Ties of the Brethren} is important if using {Desert Sunlight} style cards. Against any Deck that uses cards like {Ultimate Providence} you want to place {Geargiattacker} on the right so that it becomes chain link 2. Therefore, Providence and {Divine Wrath} will negate Attacker and not {Geargianchor}. Elsewhere, in the [Archfiend](/tier-list/deck-types/archfiends/) matchup you want to place Anchor on the right so that it become chain link two. Doing this means that you will destroy {Archfiend Empress} while the chain is ongoing. This makes Empress miss the timing so its effect to Special Summon a Monster from Graveyard is not activated. 

* You cannot flip up a Geargia the turn it is Summoned but you can on the turn it is not Summoned. Therefore, it is good to use {Powerful Rebirth} in the end phase so that you can "flip-flop" your Monsters on your turn.  

* {Geargiattacker} and {Geargianchor} do not target. Therefore, you can destroy [Hazy Flame](/tier-list/deck-types/hazy-flame/) Monsters and {Citadel Whale} without any worries.  

* It is almost always better to activate the effect of {Geargiattacker} before {Geargianchor} to force the use of, or destroy backrow cards including {Red-Eyes Spirit}/{Powerful Rebirth}.  

* Against decks which often Main Deck effect negation Counter Traps such as Sylvan I like to Summon the second Geargia before flipping face down or up to check prompts. If there is no prompt it is less likely to be a card such as {Divine Wrath} unless the opponent toggles to "OFF". Elsewhere, you may wish to set your Monster face down before Normal Summon to scout out backrow.
