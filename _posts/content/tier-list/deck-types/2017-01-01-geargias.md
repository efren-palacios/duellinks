##### Extra Info Updated

### Overview  

The Geargia deck revolves around Monsters which can flip themselves face-down and have very powerful non-targeting destruction effects when flipped face-up. Since all the Monsters are Machine type, the deck has access to a wide range of tech options. The most relevant being {Pulse Mines} which is arguably the strongest defensive backrow card in the game. The deck's strategy revolves around flipping your Monsters face-down and then flipping them face-up. {Geargiattacker} destroys Spell and Trap cards while {Geargianchor} destroys Monsters.

### Sample Deck  

ShinySopheon did an amazing job getting second place in [MCS VII](/tournaments/meta-championship-series/7/report/) with a {Restart} version of the deck which was built to abuse {Ties of the Brethren} to its fullest.

### Extra Info  

* Due to the wording of {Geargiattacker}, it can miss the timing to use its effect in situations where {Desert Sunlight} or {Ghostick Scare} is not chain-link one.  

* You cannot flip up a Geargia the turn it is Summoned but you can on the turn it is not Summoned. Therefore, it is good to use {Powerful Rebirth} in the end phase so that you can "flip-flop" your Monsters on your turn.  

* {Geargiattacker} and {Geargianchor} do not target. Therefore, you can destroy [Hazy Flame](/tier-list/deck-types/hazy-flame/) Monsters and {Citadel Whale} without any worries.  

* It is almost always better to activate the effect of {Geargiattacker} before {Geargianchor} to force the use of, or destroy backrow cards including {Red-Eyes Spirit}/{Powerful Rebirth}.
