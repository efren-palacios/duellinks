### Overview
{Sea Stealth Attack} is an incredibly powerful card but surprisingly the deck did not achieve the instant success that people thought it would. Many different builds were conceived, and few saw any success on the tournament circuit on the first week of release. Nonetheless, Sea Stealth Attack was able to take multiple spots in the Top 32 of the [MCS VI](/tournaments/meta-championship-series/6/report/) and has since become quite a popular KoG deck in the competitive community.

### Sample Deck

[deck:Mythic Depths](Gishki Chain; Gishki Chain; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Hammer Shark; Hammer Shark; Hammer Shark; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Sea Stealth Attack; Sea Stealth Attack; Curse of Anubis)

[Meta Weekly #12](/tournaments/meta-weekly/12/report/) Third Place deck by Yasser.

### Core Cards

[deck](Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Sea Stealth Attack)

There are many different ways to play this deck. Check the guide for all the differet ways to play.   

### Tech Cards

[deck](Fishborg Planter; Hammer Shark; Beautunaful Princess; That Grass Looks Greener; Windstorm of Etaqua; Warrior of Atlantis; Gishki Ariel; Gishki Beast; Wall of Disruption)

All of these cards are great additions of the deck but optional.

### Extra Info

- Cards that do not destroy but remove cards from the field, such as {Cosmic Cyclone} and {Abyss Soldier} can both bypass {Sea Stealth Attack}’s protection and remove it from the field.

- As Sea Stealth Attack’s battle effect activates in the Battle Phase, it is susceptible to being countered by {Anti-Magic Arrows}.
