##### Overview Updated

### Overview

The focus of an Ancient Gear Deck is to set up field control with monsters that are quite safe from backrow and using backrow of your own. What makes Ancient Gears so good is how the monsters deal with Backrow in a way; Ancient Gear monsters are safe from cards like {Wall of Disruption}, while {Sergeant Electro} locks down or forces sub-optimal activation of the opponent's cards. All this while you focus your own backrow to have control over you opponent's frontrow.

### Core Cards
The small core means every other card in the deck is interchangeable and the choices and ratios of such will totally depend on the meta.

### Extra Info

- If {Sergeant Electro} is already on the field, remember to use its effect as the first thing you do every Main Phase.

- Do not rush in to summon {Ancient Gear Golem} if you have other options available. Remember it doesn't protect itself.

- If your opponent has something set and it doesn't prompt any delay when you summoned a monster, performed any other action during the Main Phase, and went to the Battle Phase, its most likely {Wall of Disruption} or {Draining Shield}. This means an Ancient Gear monster is safe to attack.

- Don't make big pushes unless you are safe about it. Ancient Gears lack recovery ability.
