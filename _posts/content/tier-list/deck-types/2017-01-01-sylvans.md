#### Updated May 4, 2018 
##### Sample Deck and Overview Updated

### Overview

The Sylvans archetype emerged from the [Rampage of the Forest](/box-reviews/rampage-of-the-forest/) Mini Box and is currently the cheapest to build in comparison to the Top Tier decks such as [Geargias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/) and [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/). Each Sylvan Monster has it's own unique Field effect that allows it to excavate card(s) from the Deck and also Graveyard effects that range from destroying Monsters, backrow, boosting ATK/DEF and many more! The ideal play is to excavate multiple {Sylvan Komushroomo} and/or {Sylvan Marshalleaf} to destroy your opponents entire field and swing for a easy OTK!

### Extra Info

* When excavating {Sylvan Hermitree}, if you donâ€™t have a way to excavate again that turn the first card you choose will be the one you draw on your next turn.  

* When excavating more than one {Sylvan Guardioak}, the effect of the first one will be the next card you draw and the effect of the second Guardioak will be the card after. Bear that in mind while trying to make plays after excavating two or more Guardioak.
