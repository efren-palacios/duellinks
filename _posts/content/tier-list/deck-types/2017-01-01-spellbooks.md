#### Updated May 16, 2018 
##### Decktype Information Updated

### Overview  

The decks main focus is board control which is achieved by consistently being able to use {Spellbook of Fate} every turn to disrupt any play your opponent tries to preform. Because of {Spellbook of Secrets} and {Spellbook Magician of Prophecy} the deck is very consistent. These cards give the player access to nearly their entire deck at their fingertips. Once Spellbooks are able to setup their board, they can consistently keep and makes it extremely difficult for their opponent to break it. Spellbooks are able to stop any play that threatens their field every turn and even when threatened, Spellbooks easily bounce back. This is because of their insane comeback potential using cards like {Spellbook of Life} and recycling cards with {Spellbook of Eternity}. The deck has two main variations including a 20-Card build and a 30-Card build using {That Grass Looks Greener}. With these two variations there are tons of different ways to build this deck.
