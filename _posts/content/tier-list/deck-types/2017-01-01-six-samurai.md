#### Updated May 25, 2018 
##### Deck Info Added

### Overview
Grandmaster of the Six Samurai is the card the whole deck revolves around and is a must have at 3 copies. He allows you a free special summon as long as you have a Six Samurai monster on the board already, and by having 2 Six Samurai monsters on the board we can special summon Great Shogun Shien to have a very strong board setup. The power to overwhelm your opponent by summoning Grandmaster + Shien is the core strategy revolving the six samurai sample deck and you should be looking to get quick OTK's ending the game before turn 3 or turn 4.

### Extra Info

- Always look to have Grandmaster of the Six Samurai + a Six Samurai monster you can normal summon in your opening hand.  

- Great Shogun Shien locks your opponent down by only letting them play 1 Spell+Trap per turn. Protecting him via his effect is a great strategy.  

- Use Hand of the Six Samurai's effect to sacrifice itself to destroy an enemy monster for a quick OTK.  

- Don't be afraid to let some of your Six Samurai monsters die; we run at minimum 2 Powerful Rebirths so bringing them back from the grave isn't a problem.
