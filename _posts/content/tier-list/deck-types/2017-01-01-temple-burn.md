### Overview
Temple burn is a deck type that focuses on the card {Temple of the Mind's Eye} and small creatures with the ability to attack directly to win games. Additional to that, the deck relies on heavy backrow protection and stall cards to control the board.

As plan B, the deck contains standard Burn cards like {Lava Golem}, {Burning Land} and {Mask of the Accursed} to help you close the games faster.

### Extra Info

- LP is a resource, don't be afraid to take some hits, you have cards to recover so it is important to administrate your resources wisely.

- Cards like {Burning Land} are a double-edged sword. Don't play them immediately unless you are sure you can control the board and avoid taking hits, otherwise you will put yourself in disadvantage.

- {Temple of the Mind's Eye} can be used for offense and defense, since all the battle damage gets reduced/increased to 1000.

- Don't be afraid to force your opponent's backrow. Cards like {Inaba White Rabbit} return to the hand at the end of the turn.
