***Level 40 Farm - created by Jadehex (Last Updated: 12/22/17)***

[deck:Labyrinth Builder](Anteatereatingant; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Forbidden Chalice; Forbidden Chalice; Union Attack; Union Attack; Gravity Axe - Grarl; Gravity Axe - Grarl; Gravity Axe - Grarl; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Twister; Twister; Twister; Shield & Sword; De-Spell; De-Spell; Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell; Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell; Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell)

* **7.4k** base Duel Assessment

**Strategy:**
* *Don't be discouraged, Yami Bakura level 40 is one of the hardest gate duelists!*
* {Forbidden Chalice} and {Gravity Axe - Grarl} are for {Man-Eater Bug}
* {Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell}, {Twister}, and {De-Spell} are for {Ectoplasmer}, {Burning Land}, and {Sword of Dark Rites}
* Be **very careful** with resources early game, making sure you only set cards/keep things in hand/summon wall when necessary
* He will only activate {Ectoplasmer} with 2 or more monsters on his field, ideally you can chain {Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell} to it
* If you use {Twister} on Ectoplasmer, do it **in the end phase**, otherwise he may activate another copy
* You can wait to remove {Burning Land} until you are at 1500ish LP
* {Dark Ruler Ha Des} and 2 {Sword of Dark Rites} will swing over your {Labyrinth Wall}, so keep a twister set just in case
* Keep 1 {Gravity Axe - Grarl} in hand for the last turn

**Last turn**
* Activate {Shield & Sword}
* Flip {Labyrinth Wall} to attack mode
* Special summon {Anteatereatingant}
* Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
* Equip {Gravity Axe - Grarl} to the wall
* Use both {Union Attack}
* Attack one of his monsters with 1800 or less atk

**Replacements**
* {Anteatereatingant} > {The Fiend Megacyber} > {Guardian Grarl} (in order of reliability
* {Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell}/{Twister}/{De-Spell} > {Typhoon}/{Wild Tornado}
* {Forbidden Chalice}/{Gravity Axe - Grarl} > {Iron Blacksmith Kotetsu}
* {Shard of Greed} > {Pot of Benevolence} or other draw cards
