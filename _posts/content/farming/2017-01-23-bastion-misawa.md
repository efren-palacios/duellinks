### Farm Decks

***Level 40 Labyrinth Builder - created by Justin Joestar (last updated: 12/02/2017)***

[deck:Labyrinth Builder](Gravekeeper's Chief; Thunder Dragon; Thunder Dragon; Thunder Dragon; Gravekeeper's Recruiter; Gravekeeper's Recruiter; Gravekeeper's Recruiter; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Fusion Gate; Wonder Wand; Wonder Wand; Wonder Wand; Union Attack; Union Attack; Anti-Magic Arrows; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Jar of Greed)

> **8000 Base DA (Duel Assessment) - 100% Winrate**

**Strategy**
* Activate 'Labyrinth Builder' skill to create {Labyrinth Wall} on your field
* We've got insane draw power to make the farm quite fast, use {Wonder Wand} + {Gravekeeper's Recruiter} combo to draw quickly
* Midway through the duel either use {Wonder Wand} on {Gravekeeper's Vassal} or discard him

**Last Turn** 
		1. Fusion summon {Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon} 
		2. Summon {Gravekeeper's Chief} using {Labyrinth Wall} as tribute
		3. Special summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} from the graveyard
		4. Use {Secret Pass to the Treasures} and {Union Attack}s on {Gravekeeper's Vassal} 
		5. Activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} at the start of the Battle Phase
		6. Attack directly for victory!
	
**Replacements**
* {Wonder Wand} + {Gravekeeper's Recruiter} combo, {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced for other draw cards, e.g. {Shard of Greed}, {White Elephant's Gift}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc
* {Fusion Gate} can be replaced with {Polymerization}
* If you only have one {Union Attack} you replace the second with {Spell Reclamation}

***Speed Farm Level 10 - created by Jadehex (last updated: 12/02/2017)***

[deck](Mystical Beast of Serket; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Gil Garth; Gil Garth; Gil Garth; Battle Ox; Battle Ox; Battle Ox; Union Attack; Union Attack; Temple of the Kings; Common Charity; Common Charity; Common Charity; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon; Master of Oz; Arcana Knight Joker; Meteor B. Dragon)

> **7600 Base DA (Duel Assessment)**

**Strategy**
* Level 10 gate duelists are a decent source for SRs if you're grinding for them, this should work against any level 10 that can't get over a 1700 attack monster (excluding level 10 Alexis Rhodes) or destroy {Temple of the Kings} (excluding level 10 Seto Kaiba) 
* Remember the first effect of {Temple of the Kings} will allow you to activate one trap per turn the turn it was set
* Only have two monsters on the field at any one time as you'll need the third zone for {Gravekeeper's Vassal}

**Last Turn** 
		1. Be sure to tribute summon {Mystical Beast of Serket} before the last turn and special summon a fusion monster with at least 3500 attack
		2. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} and target it with both {Union Attack}s
		3. Attack your opponents monster with the lowest attack 

**Replacements**
* {Common Charity}, {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced for any draw cards, e.g. {Shard of Greed}, {White Elephant's Gift}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc
* You can use any six vanilla monsters with 1700+ attack, prioritise those that are gossy/prismatic for extra duel assessment points!
* If you only have one {Union Attack} you replace the second with {Spell Reclamation}
