* Only have 2 Unhappy Girls on the field, don't summon the third
* Before the last turn, make sure {Temple of the Kings} is on the field and summon {Mystical Beast of Serket}

		1. Use Serket's effect to summon {Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon}
		2. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
		3. Use {Secret Pass to the Treasures} and both {Union Attack} on Vassal 
		4. Attack directly for 9999+ damage
