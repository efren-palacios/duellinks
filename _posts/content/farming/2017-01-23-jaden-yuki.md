### Farm Decks

***Level 40 farm guide - created by Justin Taylor (last updated: 12/02/2017)***

[deck:Duel, Standby!](King of the Swamp; King of the Swamp; King of the Swamp; The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion; Buster Blader; Buster Blader; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Dark Magician; Dark Magician; Dark Magician; Fusion Recycling Plant; Union Attack; Union Attack; Polymerization; Polymerization; Polymerization; Anti-Magic Arrows; Emblem of Dragon Destroyer; Pot of Benevolence; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Dark Paladin; Dark Paladin)

> **7900 Base DA (Duel Assessment)**

**Strategy**
* Summon {Dark Paladin} as soon as possible and use his effect to negate all Jaden's {Polymerization} spells and also his field spell {Skyscraper}
* Use {King of the Swamp} + {Fusion Recycling Plant} to thin your deck if necessary
* Use {Pot of Benevolence} to avoid Jaden decking out
* You can attack Jaden's monsters every turn to bait his {Negate Attack} and attain extra duel assessment for monsters destroyed - ensure you don't deal any battle damage otherwise you'll lose your 'Effect Only Damage' bonus!

**Last Turn** 
		1. You will need 2 {Dark Paladin} on the field
		2. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} 
		3. Use {Secret Pass to the Treasures} and {Union Attack}s on {Gravekeeper's Vassal} 
		4. Use {Anti-Magic Arrows} if he didn't use his {Negate Attack}
	
**Replacements**
* {King of the Swamp} and {Fusion Recycling Plant} can be replaced for {Fusion Sage} and other 'fusion substitute' monsters
* Anti-Magic Arrows can be replaced with {Storm}
* One {Dark Paladin} can be replaced by {Dark Flare Knight}, but be sure to keep a fusion substitute so you can summon him
* If you only have one {Union Attack} you replace the second with {Spell Reclamation}

***Speed Farm Level 10 - created by Jadehex (last updated: 12/02/2017)***

[deck](Mystical Beast of Serket; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Gil Garth; Gil Garth; Gil Garth; Battle Ox; Battle Ox; Battle Ox; Union Attack; Union Attack; Temple of the Kings; Common Charity; Common Charity; Common Charity; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon; Master of Oz; Arcana Knight Joker; Meteor B. Dragon)

> **7600 Base DA (Duel Assessment)**

**Strategy**
* Level 10 gate duelists are a decent source for SRs  if you're grinding for them, this should work against any level 10 that can't get over a 1700 attack monster (excluding level 10 Alexis Rhodes) or destroy {Temple of the Kings} (excluding level 10 Seto Kaiba) 
* Remember the first effect of {Temple of the Kings} will allow you to activate one trap per turn the turn it was set
* Only have two monsters on the field at any one time as you'll need the third zone for {Gravekeeper's Vassal}
*  

**Last Turn:** 
		1. Be sure to tribute summon {Mystical Beast of Serket} before the last turn and special summon a fusion monster with at least 3500 attack
		2. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} and target it with both {Union Attack}s
		3. Attack your opponents monster with the lowest attack 

**Replacements**
* {Common Charity}, {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced for any draw cards, e.g. {Shard of Greed}, {White Elephant's Gift}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc
* You can use any six vanilla monsters with 1700+ attack, prioritise those that are gossy/prismatic for extra duel assessment points!
* If you only have one {Union Attack} you replace the second with {Spell Reclamation}
