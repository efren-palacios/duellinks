### Farm Decks

#### Level 40 Labyrinth Builder - created by Jadehex (last updated: 12/05/2017
(7300 Base [Duel Assessment](/farming/duel-assessment-score/))

[deck:Labyrinth Builder](The Fiend Megacyber; Gravekeeper's Vassal; A Cat of Ill Omen; A Cat of Ill Omen; Union Attack; Union Attack; Shield & Sword; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Legacy of Yata-Garasu; Legacy of Yata-Garasu; Legacy of Yata-Garasu; Burst Rebirth; Burst Rebirth; Burst Rebirth; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Destruction Jammer; Destruction Jammer; Destruction Jammer)

**Strategy**

* If you use {Burst Rebirth} to special summon {Labyrinth Wall} you are 100% safe
* Chazz can only destroy face-up monsters with {Lightning Vortex}/{Armed Dragon LV5}/{Armed Dragon LV7}
* Although he can destroy a spell/trap with {Stamping Destruction}
* You can try to mitigate this by setting 2 {Burst Rebirth} or sitting on your other traps and then chain them to {Stamping Destruction} - he tends to target recently set traps
* We're also using {Destruction Jammer} as insurance to stall for {Burst Rebirth} (remember to save non-important cards for the cost!)

**Last Turn** 

1. Activate {Shield & Sword}
2. Switch {Labyrinth Wall} into attack position
3. Special summon {The Fiend Megacyber}
4. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} 
5. Use {Secret Pass to the Treasures} and {Union Attack}s on {Gravekeeper's Vassal} 
6. Attack directly for victory!
	
**Replacements**

* {Destruction Jammer} can be replaced by {My Body as a Shield}
* While you can replace {Burst Rebirth} with {My Body as a Shield} it is not recommended as the LP payment conflicts with {Burst Rebirth}
* {The Fiend Megacyber} can be replaced with {Anteatereatingant} or {Darkflare Dragon} (requires decklist change: remove two {Jar of Greed}, add {Dark Mimic LV1}/{Dekoichi the Battlechanted Locomotive} and {Skelengel})
* If you only have one {Union Attack} you replace the second with {Spell Reclamation}

#### Speed Farm Level 10 - created by Jadehex (last updated: 12/02/2017
(7600 Base [Duel Assessment](/farming/duel-assessment-score/))

[deck](Mystical Beast of Serket; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Gil Garth; Gil Garth; Gil Garth; Battle Ox; Battle Ox; Battle Ox; Union Attack; Union Attack; Temple of the Kings; Common Charity; Common Charity; Common Charity; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon; Master of Oz; Arcana Knight Joker; Meteor B. Dragon)

**Strategy**

* Level 10 gate duelists are a decent source for SRs  if you're grinding for them, this should work against any level 10 that can't get over a 1700 attack monster (excluding level 10 Alexis Rhodes) or destroy {Temple of the Kings} (excluding level 10 Seto Kaiba) 
* Remember the first effect of {Temple of the Kings} will allow you to activate one trap per turn the turn it was set
* Only have two monsters on the field at any one time as you'll need the third zone for {Gravekeeper's Vassal}

**Last Turn** 

1. Be sure to tribute summon {Mystical Beast of Serket} before the last turn and special summon a fusion monster with at least 3500 attack
2. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} and target it with both {Union Attack}s
3. Attack your opponents monster with the lowest attack 

**Replacements**

* {Common Charity}, {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced for any draw cards, e.g. {Shard of Greed}, {White Elephant's Gift}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc
* You can use any six vanilla monsters with 1700+ attack, prioritise those that are gossy/prismatic for extra duel assessment points!
* If you only have one {Union Attack} you replace the second with {Spell Reclamation}
