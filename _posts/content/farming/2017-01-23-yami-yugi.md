#### Level 30/40 Generic Cerberus Farm - created by Jadehex
(7100 Base [Duel Assessment](/farming/duel-assessment-score/))

**This is just a generic Cerberus farm decklist, you can optimize it however you want!**

[deck:Draw Sense: LIGHT](Mythical Beast Cerberus; Riryoku; Gaia Power; Spell Power Grasp; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Wonder Wand; Wonder Wand; Twister; Blustering Winds; Blustering Winds; Blustering Winds; Stop Defense; Pot of Benevolence; Hieroglyph Lithograph; Hieroglyph Lithograph; Blue Medicine; Mooyan Curry; Mooyan Curry)

**Strategy**
- Take 1500 Damage so you can activate {Draw Sense: LIGHT} to draw {Mythical Beast Cerberus}.
- Summon Cerberus and activate enough Spells so it has ATK points higher than what Yami Yugi can reach (2400 ATK is a safe point).
- Keep activating Spells until you draw the last card of your deck.
- Use these cards to manage your LP so you can achieve ["LP on the Brink"](/farming/duel-assessment-score/).
    - 2x {Hieroglyph Lithograph} or {Abyssal Designator}
	- 2x {Mooyan Curry}
	- 1x {Blue Medicine}
	- 1x {Twister}
	- 1x {Pot of Benevolence}

**Last Turn**
- Use {Stop Defense} and then {Riryoku} on one of Yami Yugi's Monsters.
- Activate all the Spells left in your hand but prioritize reaching 100 LP unless you don't have enough ATK points to deal 9999+ Damage.
- Finally, attack his Attack position Monster and claim victory!

**Replacements**
- Literally none of the Spells matter except {Stop Defense} and {Riryoku} as long as you can still deal 9999+ Damage.
- {Stop Defense} can be replaced by {Shooting Star Bow - Ceal}, {Big Bang Shot}, {Fairy Meteor Crush} etc.
- Skill can be swapped for {Draw Sense: Low Level}.
