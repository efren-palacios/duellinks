### Farm Decks

#### Level 40 Labyrinth Builder - created by Jadehex 
(7300 Base [Duel Assessment](/farming/duel-assessment-score/))
Last updated: 12/06/2017

[deck:Labyrinth Builder](Anteatereatingant; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Union Attack; Union Attack; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Shard of Greed; Shield & Sword; Acidic Downpour; Acidic Downpour; Acidic Downpour; Pot of Benevolence; Pot of Benevolence; Pot of Benevolence; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Floodgate Trap Hole; Floodgate Trap Hole; Floodgate Trap Hole; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed)

*Note: This build is not F2P or new player friendly - look below for a more accessible Ojama farm!*

**Strategy**

* Aster's biggest threats take three monsters to summon so you have a little bit of time to prepare your wall for them
* {Floodgate Trap Hole} is currently the best way to stop {Destiny HERO - Plasma} - you can't have him face up
* {Acidic Downpour} is all you need to stop {Destiny HERO - Dogma}, but if you can't draw it {Floodgate Trap Hole} works too
* {Destiny End Dragoon}, ironically enough, is the least threatening as he doesn't use its effect to destroy your {Labyrinth Wall}

**Last Turn** 

1. Activate {Shield & Sword}
2. Switch {Labyrinth Wall} into attack position
3. Send {Acidic Downpour} and one other spell/trap to the graveyard to special summon {Anteatereatingant} in attack position
4. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} 
5. Use {Secret Pass to the Treasures} and {Union Attack}s on {Gravekeeper's Vassal} 
6. Attack directly for victory!
	
**Replacements**

* {Floodgate Trap Hole} could be replaced by {Divine Wrath} - honestly if you don't have {Floodgate Trap Hole} try the less consistent but more accessible Ojama farm
* {Anteatereatingant} can be replaced by {The Fiend Megacyber} or {Darkflare Dragon} (requires decklist change: remove two {Jar of Greed}, add {Dark Mimic LV1}/{Dekoichi the Battlechanted Locomotive} and {Skelengel})
* If you only have one {Union Attack} you replace the second with {Spell Reclamation}

#### Level 40 Ojama Farm - created by Jadehex 
(7600 Base [Duel Assessment](/farming/duel-assessment-score/))
Last updated: 12/06/2017

[deck:Duel, Standby!](Ojama Blue; Ojama Blue; Ojama Blue; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Planet Pathfinder; Planet Pathfinder; Ojama Black; Ojama Black; Ojama Yellow; Ojama Yellow; Ojama Green; Ojama Green; Fusion Recycling Plant; Union Attack; Union Attack; Polymerization; Polymerization; Polymerization; Shield & Sword; Secret Pass to the Treasures; Ojama Knight; Ojama Knight; Ojama Knight)

*Note: The consistency of this deck is around 70%*

**Strategy**

* Summon {Ojama Knight} ASAP, You need to lock up at least one of Aster's zones, if he summons Dogma, Dragoon, or Plasma you lose.
* After that, you need to use {Ojama Blue}, {Planet Pathfinder}, and {Fusion Recycling Plant} to keep thinning your deck.
* Aster has 3 {Destiny Draw} and 3 {Destiny HERO - Diamond Dude} - he mills his cards **fast**!

**Last Turn** 

1. Summon a second {Ojama Knight} (if you didn't already earlier in the duel)
2. Activate {Shield & Sword}
3. Switch both {Ojama Knight}s into attack position
4. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} 
5. Use {Secret Pass to the Treasures} and {Union Attack}s on {Gravekeeper's Vassal} 
6. Attack directly for victory!
	
**Replacements**

* {Fusion Recycling Plant} + {Planet Pathfinder} combo can be replaced for {King of the Swamp}, {Fusion Sage} etc 
* {Sword & Shield} can be replaced for {Ojama Country}
* {Ojama Blue} can be replaced for {Painful Decision}
* If you only have one {Union Attack} you replace the second with {Spell Reclamation}
* Alternatively, you can use the skills 'Restart' or 'Balance'

#### Speed Farm Level 10 - created by Jadehex 
(7600 Base [Duel Assessment](/farming/duel-assessment-score/))
Last updated: 12/02/2017

[deck](Mystical Beast of Serket; Gravekeeper's Vassal; Gil Garth; Gil Garth; Gil Garth; Battle Ox; Battle Ox; Battle Ox; Union Attack; Union Attack; Temple of the Kings; Common Charity; Common Charity; Common Charity; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Good Goblin Housekeeping; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon; Master of Oz; Arcana Knight Joker; Meteor B. Dragon)

**Strategy**

* Level 10 gate duelists are a decent source for SRs  if you're grinding for them, this should work against any level 10 that can't get over a 1700 attack monster (excluding level 10 Alexis Rhodes) or destroy {Temple of the Kings} (excluding level 10 Seto Kaiba) 
* Remember the first effect of {Temple of the Kings} will allow you to activate one trap per turn the turn it was set
* Only have two monsters on the field at any one time as you'll need the third zone for {Gravekeeper's Vassal}

**Last Turn** 

1. Be sure to tribute summon {Mystical Beast of Serket} before the last turn and special summon a fusion monster with at least 3500 attack
2. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} and target it with both {Union Attack}s
3. Attack your opponents monster with the lowest attack 

**Replacements**

* {Common Charity}, {Good Goblin Housekeeping} and {Jar of Greed} can be replaced for any draw cards, e.g. {Shard of Greed}, {White Elephant's Gift}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc
* You can use any six vanilla monsters with 1700+ attack, prioritise those that are gossy/prismatic for extra duel assessment points!
* If you only have one {Union Attack} you replace the second with {Spell Reclamation}
