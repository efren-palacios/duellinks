### Farm Decks

***Level 40 Ra Farm - created by Jadehex (last updated: 12/15/2017)***

[deck:Destiny Draw](The Winged Dragon of Ra; Kiseitai; Kiseitai; Cosmic Compass; Double Summon; Draining Shield; Draining Shield; Draining Shield; The Golden Apples; The Golden Apples; The Golden Apples; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Jar of Greed; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Massivemorph; Enchanted Javelin; Enchanted Javelin; Enchanted Javelin )

> **7300 Base DA (Duel Assessment)**

**Strategy**
* Early game you want to use {The Golden Apples} and {Enchanting Javelin} to activate your Destiny Draw skill and stall until she summons {Cyber Angel Dakini}
* Use whatever you can to survive except for {Kiseitai}
* After she has summoned {Cyber Angel Dakini}, set a {Kiseitai}, {Massivemorph} the monster it latches on to (usually {Cyber Angel Dakini})
* Only use one {Kiseitai}, save the second for after she destroys the first with the effect of {Cyber Prima}
* At this point the LP heal from {Kiseitai} should be counteracting the battle  damage you take, especially after a second {Massivemorph}
* You shouldn't have a problem having well over 10,000 LP at this point especially in conjunction with your other healing cards
* Use {Jar of Greed} to thin your deck and keep up with Alexis' thinning

> **Tip 1** 
She tends not to tribute {Massivemorph}ed monsters so its entirely viable to stall with {Massivemorph} on {Cyber Angel Idaten}/{Gemini Elf}s if you need to
**Tip 2 - Stall Combos** 
Chain {Massivemorph} to {Draining Shield}/{Enchanted Javelin} for double LP gain
Chain {Enchanted Javelin} to {Draining Shield} for double LP gain

**Last Turn** 
		1. Activate {Double Summon} (she shouldn't activate {Spell Shield Type-8} to negate)
		2. Summon {Cosmic Compass} and summon two tokens
		3. Tribute the tokens for {The Winged Dragon of Ra} (activate on summon effect)
		4. {The Winged Dragon of Ra} should have more than enough attack points to do 9,999+ damage through whatever monster she has on the field in attack position
	
**Replacements**
* You can replace {Jar of Greed} with other draw cards such as {Good Goblin Housekeeping}, {Shard of Greed}, {Legacy of Yata-Garasu} etc
* You can replace LP heal cards with {Aegis of Gaia} (decent but clogs your field) and {Nutrient Z} (only activatable against monsters with 2000+ attack)
* Can replace skill with 'Extra, Extra' - allows you to double up on stalling cards
*  Can replace skill with 'Duel, Standby!' - five card starting hand = less chances of bricking (relatively low regardless with only 3 endgame cards)
* If you only have one {Union Attack} you replace the second with {Spell Reclamation}
