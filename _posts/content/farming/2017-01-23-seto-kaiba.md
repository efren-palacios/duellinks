* Kaiba doesn't attack the tokens with {D.D. Warrior}
* Once you get a BEWD token you just need to protect your life points from his {Enemy Controller} tribute-take play

**Last turn:** 
		1. Use {Double Summon}
		2. Summon {Gravekeeper's Vassal} + {Fire King Avatar Yaksha}
		3. Use {Secret Pass to the Treasures} and both {Union Attack} on Vassal 
		4. Activate {Anti-Magic Arrows} at the start of the Battle Phase
		5. Attack directly 
	
**Replacements**
* Yaksha can be replaced with any 1650+ attack beater
