With the recent release of [Valiant Souls](/box-reviews/valiant-souls/) and [Rampage of the Forest](/box-reviews/rampage-of-the-forest/), {Sea Stealth Attack} has lost popularity due to newer decks such as [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/), [Geargias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/) and [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/) gaining ground in the meta.

This deck breakdown will expand upon [BuilttoTilts guide](/guides/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack-guide-by-builttotilt/), explaining how to play against the most relevant new decks and what new options you have to counter the meta when choosing your tech and side deck options.

### My Sea Stealth Attack Deck

[deck](Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Gishki Chain; Gishki Chain; Gishki Chain; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Paleozoic Canadia; Paleozoic Canadia; Sea Stealth Attack; Powerful Rebirth; Powerful Rebirth)

- 3 x {Citadel Whale} (Whale):   
The main boss Monster and one reason why this deck has many good matchups. The effect to search {Sea Stealth Attack} one of the strongest Traps in this game makes this card a really dangerous threat. But this is not the only effect this card has, its second effect to negate targeting cards like {Enemy Controller}, {"A" Cell Recombination Device} and {Sylvan Marshalleaf} is very valuable. On the other hand, one reason this deck has lost popularity is the rise of {Geargianchor} and the fact that it's removal effect doesn't target, meaning your only way to protect Whale will be via banishing with {Sea Stealth Attack}. This will often leave you open for a quick OTK, which is one of the reasons Whale is trending away from the turbo build into a more defensive deck.

- 3 x {Abyss Soldier} (Soldier):   
It's a great answer to almost any Monster in the game, from {Geargianchor} to {Masked HERO Anki} and {Sylvan Komushroomo}. It's versatility and synergy with the rest of the deck really puts Soldier in a league of his own.

- 3x {Gishki Chain} (Chain):  
This is one of the best options for boosting the consistency of the deck, as it doesn't rely on being destroyed by battle like {Skreech}. The ability to arrange the top 3 cards of your deck in any way you like makes this card really strong and important for this Whale build. With Chain your {Fishborg Planter} won’t brick and comes back from the Graveyard 100%. You can also put Whale on top of the deck to mill it with {Fishborg Planter}.

- 3 x {Fishborg Planter} (Fishborg):   
This card is what makes the Whale Summoning and having fodder for Sea Stealth Attack very consistent. Once you have Fishborg and {Citadel Whale} in the Graveyard you can turn every water Monster into a Whale by Summoning Fishborg Planter from the Graveyard and then Summoning Citadel Whale. 

- 3 x {Enemy Controller}:  
I think I’m not lying when I say that Enemy Controller is the best tech card in the game. It can be used to defend or to go for lethal by taking control of your opponent’s Monster.

- 2 x {Paleozoic Canadia} (Canadia):   
Newest addition to the deck. With this card you can stop a [Geargia](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/) player activating their {Ties of the Brethren}. Besides that it also stops Monster effects from your opponent by setting it to face down defense position. If you have Canadia in your Graveyard you can turn your {Powerful Rebirth} into a Whale Summon because Paleozoic Traps return as a Monster if you activate a Trap.

- 1 x {Sea Stealth Attack}:   
The first question will probably be now: "why only one Sea Stealth Attack?", well let me explain that. If your opponent tries to destroy it with a {Sylvan Komushroomo} or a {Geargiattacker} you can banish one water Monster until the end phase to protect all face up Spell and Traps you control. The only way to make Sea Stealth Attack's effect useless is by banishing your field Spell {Umi} with a {Cosmic Cyclone} and that’s the reason why only one Sea Stealth Attack. If they banish {Umi} you don’t have any way to get the effects of Sea Stealth Attack back. Also it’s searchable with {Citadel Whale} so you don’t need to draw into it. On the other hand you can protect your water Monsters from cards like {Wall of Disruption} and {Super Rush Headlong} by banishing your Monster until the end phase. The second effect of this card turns your {Citadel Whale} into a real Monster because Sea Stealth Attack destroys every Monster Whale battles with and it won’t trigger face down {Sylvan Komushroomo}, {Geargiattacker} or {Geargianchor}. 

- 2 x {Powerful Rebirth}:    
It makes Whale Summons easier and provides a card combo with a {Paleozoic Canadia} in the Graveyard. Also the Monsters get a 100 ATK and DEF boost which can come in handy. 

### Matchups

- [Geargias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/):   
This is the hardest matchup for you because {Citadel Whale} can’t stop the effect of {Geargianchor} since it doesn’t target. If they get a Turn 1 {Ties of the Brethren} there is not much you can do. You need to side well against this variant. Some Geargia variants opt to run 9 monsters with {Balance} as showcased by Sir Dillweed in the top cut of [MCS VII](). This build is much easier to tackle, as they don't run Ties of the Brethren, and without the Swarm capability that it offers their monsters are easy to pick off with Abyss Soldier.

- [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/):   
{Abyss Soldier} is your win condition. You need to bounce their face down monsters cause those are most likely {Sylvan Komushroomo}. But you need to be aware of their {Ultimate Providence} and {Divine Wrath}. Once you got a {Citadel Whale} out it’s hard for them to deal with it since only a {Sylvan Hermitree} can destroy it and only if it’s summoned by a {Rose Lover}.

- [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/):   
There are 2 variants of Masked Herose. One is with a fusion engine that focuses around getting {Destiny Hero Dangerous} out turn one to setup for a {Destiny HERO - Celestial} Draw effect. Against this version the matchup isn’t easy, you need to focus on bouncing and stopping the {Destiny HERO Anki} before it OTKs you. The second version is without the fusion engine, it only plays 9 monsters. Since they don't have a way to set up a {Destiny HERO - Celestial} play like the fusion variant this deck is much easier to control with {Abyss Soldier} and {Citadel Whale}, as they will have a hard time getting to their key cards without a draw engine. Once you get a Whale out it will be hard for them to deal with you and also keep focusing on bouncing with Soldier like in every match.

The other matchups you can read on [BuilToTilts guide](/guides/deck-types/sea-stealth-attack-guide-by-builttotilt/).

### Side Deck Options

[deck](Lava Golem; Needle Ceiling; Magic Deflector; Different Dimension Ground; System Down)

- {Lava Golem}:  
One of the best monster removal in the game. You can tribute off 2 of your opponents monster to special summon it on their side. It’s a very good card against [Geargias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/), because if they use {Ties of the Brethren} they lose 2000 Life Points, so they get burned out in 2 turns by {Lava Golem}. There is also big synergy with {Abyss Soldier}. You can summon Lava Golem to your opponent and then bounce it back with Abyss Soldier.

- {Needle Ceiling}:  
This is also very strong against [Geargias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/). If you start with {Needle Ceiling} in your opening hand and your opponents plays a {Ties of the Brethren} you can use {Needle Ceiling} to clear their entire field. Pro tip: you can banish one of your water monsters with {Sea Stealth Attack} to protect it, you don’t mind losing a {Fishborg Planter}.

- {Magic Deflector}:   
It's a good card overall. It stops your opponents from using {Super Rush Headlong} which is a big threat to this deck, because {Super Rush Headlong} destroys before {Sea Stealth Attack} effect comes through. It also stops {Mask Change} which can be devastating. Also if you are afraid of your {Umi} getting banished by {Cosmic Cyclone} you can use this as a side deck option.

- {Different Dimension Ground}:   
This is mainly for the [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/) matchup. If they flip {Sylvan Komushroomo} you chain {Different Dimension Ground}. They won’t be able to get their excavated effects because they will be banished and not sent to the Graveyard. But don’t forget that you can’t use it in Damage Step which means you can’t chain it when the Sylvan Komushroomo flips when you attack into it.

- {System Down}:  
It is another great card against [Geargias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/). Banishing all Machine type monsters from the field and Graveyard effectively neuters the most common backrow seen in the deck like {Pulse Mines} and {Powerful Rebirth}. However, as Geargia monsters have the ability to flip themselves face down, they can easily play around {System Down} and capitalise on their face down Geargia monsters in your turn with cards like {Desert Sunlight} and {Ghostrick Scare}.

### Conclusion

Sea Stealth Attack is still a strong deck with a powerful boss monster. It also has good support cards with {Gishki Chain} and {Abyss Soldier}. Also keep in mind the lower this deck gets on the tier list the less people will side against it. Make sure you are well prepared for cards that threaten the play style such as {Ties of the Brethren}.

Thanks for reading and have fun with the guide.
