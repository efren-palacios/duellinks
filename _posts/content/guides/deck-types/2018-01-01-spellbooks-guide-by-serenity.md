### Introduction & History
 
Spellbooks came with the release of [Visions of Ice](/box-reviews/visions-of-ice/) and quickly became an extremely dominate deck and quite the force to be reckoned with.  Their consistency, strong OTK potential and board control make Spellbooks worthy of their spot on the Tier 1 list. Although Spellbooks are strong, it doesn’t mean they’re easy. This guide will show you the ins and outs of the archetype and how to play them to their full potential in the competitive scene.  

#### About the Author
I am a 10 x KoG and achieved Top 500 in the latest KC Cup. I have won multiple [anytime tournaments](/tournaments/anytime-tournament/5/report/) and topped several other tournaments using the Spellbook decktype.

### Decklist Breakdown

#### Skills  

* **{Restart}:**  
Spellbooks primary skill. Although Spellbooks are consistent, they can be susceptible to bricking if they do not open at least one of their core cards. It also helps when siding in specific match up cards so you can Restart to make sure you get them. 

* **{Grit}:**  
Because of the current meta, Grit is incredibly strong with many decks. This skill helps with those tougher matchups such as [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/) preventing those OTKs. Grit works so well with Spellbooks because of Spellbooks strong comeback potential. In one turn, entire boards can be made and Grit allows those comebacks to happen.  

* **{Balance}:**  
Used in some 20 card variants for pure consistency in getting 1 monster and 3 spells in nearly every starting hand.

#### Core Cards  
[deck](Spellbook Magician of Prophecy;Spellbook of Secrets;Prophecy Destroyer;Reaper of Prophecy;Fool of Prophecy;That Grass Looks Greener;Spellbook of Life;Spellbook of Fate;Spellbook of Eternity;Spellbook of Power;Spellbook of the Master;Spellbook Library of The Crescent)

* Spellbook Magician of Prophecy (A.K.A. Blue Boy) [Optimal Count: 2-3]  
This is 1 of the 2 super generic searchers in the deck, You want to draw at least 1 Blue Boy or Secret in your starting hand.

* Spellbook of Secrets [Optimal Count: 3]  
Same as Blue Boy, having 6 copies of these generic searchers makes the deck very consistent and you’ll likely open one in your starting hand.

* Prophecy Destroyer [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
This is the main boss monster of the deck, a 2500 beater that can consistently be special summoned from the grave.

* Reaper of Prophecy [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
The playmaker of the deck, when this card is summoned and is able to activate all of its effects the controller gets a huge swing in tempo and card advantage.

* Fool of Prophecy [Optimal Count: 3]  
What will mainly be bringing out Reaper and it’s full effects. Running 3 of this card makes the deck very consistent.

* That Grass Looks Greener [Optimal Count: 3]  
This card gives Spellbook players access to nearly their entire deck if they’ll able to resolve this effect. With proper follow up entire boards are consistently created in single turns starting from this card.

* Spellbook of Life [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
Amazing follow up for That Grass Looks Greener. From Grass milling a Fool or Reaper quite commonly, you’ll be able to bring out one of those monsters are get your entire engine running and great a giant board presence. Can also be used in tight situations in the late game to get a special summon off.
 
* Spellbook of Fate [Optimal Count: 3]  
This is the powerhouse of your deck and what will be single handedly controlling the board. A main goal of this deck is to get “Spellbook” spell cards in the graveyard so this cards third effect is activatable to disrupt your opponents moves. This card is also very hard to get around because it doesn’t target and devastating if it hits something big because it banishes.

* Spellbook of Eternity [Optimal Count: 2-3]  
This card is very important for recycling cards that were banished by the effects of Spellbook of Fate and Prophecy Destroyer.

* Spellbook of Power [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
Power is very beneficial to get over really big monsters and being able to search another Spellbook from your deck when you destroy a monster you used Spellbook of Power on.

* Spellbook of the Master [Optimal Count: 2-3]  
This card will mainly mimic the effect of “Spellbook of Secrets” during a search cycle, but can also be used for other cards whenever needed like Eternity and Power.

* Spellbook Library of The Crescent [Optimal Count: 0-2]  
This card is amazing to start the duel with as it can only be activated when you have no “Spellbook” spell cards in your graveyard. It’s also searchable with Blue Boy so you can frequently have in Turn 1.


#### Tech Cards
This can purely be based on user preference and are not limited to these cards
[deck](Enemy Controller;Sphere Kuriboh;Treacherous Trap Hole;The Tricky;Magical Marionette;Cursed Seal of The Forbidden Spell;Dark Magician of Chaos;Cosmic Cyclone)

* Enemy Controller:  
This card is great and has always been great. Works well in this deck for both Protection and OTK potential. This can replace Sphere Kuriboh.

* Sphere Kuriboh:  
Great handtrap that your opponent won’t expect and gives the protection Spellbooks lack. This can replace Enemy Controller.

* Treacherous Trap Hole:  
This card is an amazing one of to have and is really useful in Spellbooks because they run no traps. It’s a straight up +1 in card advantage and overall is very strong. Helps in a lot of sticky situations.

* The Tricky:  
Used in some variants of Spellbooks, can be great to get out multiple monsters in one turn or set up for a tribute summon.

* Magical Marionette:  
A strong monster that’ll usually come out with Reaper. Is about to control the board very well because of its easy access to monster removal.

* Cursed Seal of The Forbidden Spell:  
A great counter trap that can easily be activated with extra/dead Spellbooks in your hand. Negating key spells and making sure they can’t be activated again could be devastating for some decks such as Masked Heroes having their {Mask Change} negated or in the mirror match, negating a key spellbook spells like Spellbook of Fate or Spellbook of Secrets.

* Dark Magician of Chaos:  
Strong 2800 boss monster that can be special summoned by the effect of Reaper of Prophecy and recycles a spellbook from your graveyard and adds it to your hand during the end phase of it’s summon.

* Cosmic Cyclone:  
Very effective to both counter the current meta and serve as generic backrow removal.

### Combos

#### Basic Graveyard Set Up:  
If one Blue Boy/Spellbook of Secrets (Or Both) and one Crescent/Spellbook of The Master/Spellbook of Fate/graveyard Fuel (Organization and Power) is in possession, you can have Fate’s 3rd effect be activated during your opponent's turn using this search combo:  
* Activate Secrets (Do this second if you have Crescent) 
* Search Spellbook Magician of Prophecy/Vise Versa if starting with Spellbook Magician of Prophecy
* Summon Blue Boy
* Search Master
* Activate Master, copy Secrets 
* Search Fate/Graveyard Fuel[Power/Organization] (Depending on the other spellbook you already have in your hand)


#### Turn 1 Fool Combo:  
This combo can help you dominate the board very early on as you’ll be able to bring out Reaper of Prophecy without the help of That Grass Looks Greener
This is a 3 card combo that consists of:  
**Fool of Prophecy, Spellbook of The Master, and either Eternity or Fate**  
* Summon Fool  
* Send Secrets to the Graveyard  
* Activate Master copy Secrets search Fate or Eternity depending on which one you don’t already have in your hand  
* Set Eternity  
* Activate Fate’s first effect  
* Banish Secrets return Eternity (Or an opponent’s back row if you’re doing this turn 2)   
* Activate Eternity, bring Secrets to hand   
* Activate Secrets, search Graveyard Fuel (Power/Organization)  
* Activate Graveyard Fuel  


#### Helpful Tips:  
* If you can, make sure you have follow up for your next turn whenever creating a board. Backup such as Spellbook of Eternity or Spellbook of Secrets can go a long way into recreating a damaged or broken board.  

* When playing Fool of Prophecy, when Fool’s second effect is activated to summon Reaper of Prophecy in the End Phase, you can use Reaper’s search to get that follow up card such as Spellbook of Eternity or Spellbook of Secrets for next turn.  

* When playing Fool of Prophecy, if you are able to activate Fool’s second effect to summon Reaper of Prophecy and have not yet used Fate while your opponent currently controls cards on the field; turn your toggle to **ON** and search Spellbook of Fate. After you special summon your second monster using Reaper of Prophecy, you will be given a prompt to use Spellbook of Fate during that end phase. Doing this, you can remove a potentially problematic card your opponent controls and still be able to use another Spellbook of Fate on your opponent’s turn.  

* When banishing Spellbooks with the effect of Spellbook of Fate or Prophecy Destroyer, Prioritize banishing Spellbook of Fate, Spellbook of Life, Spellbook of Power, Spellbook Organization, and excess Spellbook of Secrets. This makes sure you keep a wide variety of different Spellbook names in your graveyard for Fool and Reaper effect and being able to get those Key or 1 of Spellbooks such as Fate, Secrets, and Power back to your hand with Spellbook of Eternity.  

* When using the skill Restart, normally you want to keep hands that can get you a Spellcaster and an activatable Fate on turn one or a hand with That Grass Looks Greener with Spellbook of Life or a way to dig for Spellbook of Life to special summon Fool of Prophecy or Reaper of Prophecy.

### Matchups
What to do in every current meta matchup in order of hardest to easiest.  

#### Drilldark Heroes:
By far the hardest current matchup for Spellbooks. If you’re only able to set up a field of a Blue Boi and Fate and they can get a {Destiny Hero - Drilldark} and another level 4 monster with {Mask Change} in hand it is impossible to win. In this matchup if you are running {Restart}, try to Restart for a hand that contains That Grass Looks Greener or a hand where you can pull off Fool of Prophecy turn 1 and try to establish a board as quickly as possible. Go aggressive with Spellbook of Fate whenever possible and make sure to banish {Destiny HERO - Celestial} or Single Monsters they control as they cannot chain Mask Change to it without having their Anki banished in place of their other monster.  
* Good side deck cards for this matchup are: {Warrior Elimination}  

#### Fusion Heroes:
The most common Hero deck, and yet still somewhat a problem for Spellbooks. Luckily, this variant likely won’t run any Drilldark at all, yet sometimes they will run 1-2. A common open Heroes will have is {Vision HERO Vyon}. If you have Fate activatable, banish Vyon after activating it’s first effect depending on what they send. If they send anything other than {Destiny Hero - Malicious} then banish Vyon after that effect resolves, otherwise do not. An aggressive play Heroes might do is summon Vyon, send Malicious to the graveyard and special summon Malicious in attack mode, if this happens it is safe to assume they have {Mask Change} in hand. Assuming you only have a Blue Boi and Fate set, during the battle phase, activate Fate’s second effect and set Blue Boy. This will ensure you won’t die that turn if they don’t have {Forbidden Chalice}. Setting Blue Boy will not only keep you alive but give you another search to make a comeback next turn.  
* Good side deck cards for this matchup are: {Warrior Elimination}  

#### Amazoness:
The last of the “difficult” matchups for Spellbooks. Amazoness’s swarming capability can be problematic for spellbooks when they don’t start with That Grass Looks Greener. What to banish with Spellbook of Fate depends on the situation. If you were able to create a strong board consisting of your boss monsters you want to ideally banish {Amazoness Onslaught} although banishing {Amazoness Queen} is also very helpful if they are able to get it out on time. If you were not able to establish a board and have to resort to Blue Boy beatdown, banish what ever your opponent summons is the way to go. Make sure to banish {Amazoness Princess} are the start of the battle phase to prevent her from activating his first effect on attack declaration.  
* Good side deck cards for this matchup are: {Warrior Elimination}, {Cosmic Cyclone}, and {Magical Marionette}  

#### Sylvans:
Sylvans is one of the easiest matchups for Spellbooks as being able to banish any set {Sylvan Komushroomo}, {Rose Lover}, or {World Carrotweight Champion} slows down Sylvans so much making them take an extremely long time to create a board and inevitably losing before they could even summon one of their boss monsters. Focus on banishing anything they set or summon immediately, unless they have set back row, in which you can banish that set back row during the endphase to prevent it’s activation whether it be {Enemy Controller} or {Treacherous Trap Hole} then activate Fate once again to banish their set monster during your turn as well.  
*Good side deck cards for this matchup are: {Different Dimension Ground}, {Fragrance Storm}, and {Nobleman of Crossout}  

#### Aliens:
Aliens is one of those 50/50 matchups where in the right circumstances they can swarm the field and leave you defenseless. The core of their deck is to put A-Counters on your monster to Lower your monster’s attack, destroy you back row with {Alien Telepath} and special summon {Alien Overlord}. You want to be able to prevent this before they are able to use it to their advantage. If your opponent uses {"A" Cell Recombination Device} to put counters on one of your monsters during your end phase, then you can activate Spellbook of Fate on their draw phase, flipping down the monster with those A-Counters rendering those counters useless.  
* Good side deck cards for this matchup are: {Cosmic Cyclone}  

#### Mirror Match:
The Spellbook mirror can be very coin flip based as whoever goes first has a huge advantage over the opposing player. In the Spellbook mirror matchup using Spellbook of Fate to banish the monsters they summon immediately leaves them with nothing to protect themselves with. Ways to win the mirror when going second is to use tech cards such as The Tricky and Treacherous Trap Hole to gain tempo and take back the field.  
* Good side deck cards for this matchup are: {Cosmic Cyclone}, {The Tricky}, and {Last Day of Witch}
