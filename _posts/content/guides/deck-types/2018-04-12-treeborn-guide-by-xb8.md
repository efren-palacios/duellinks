### Introduction  

I like deck building and theory crafting. I have suggested several decks for other players to use to get KOG including the Ra’s Disciple OTK deck. I’m always looking for the next fun and competitive deck that no one sees coming. Right now the meta is OTK based and its easy to survive this with 3 {Sphere Kuriboh} and {Enemy Controller} take options. Most decks dont have a follow up after their combo and treeborn decks really take advantage of that.  

I am writing this guide because I feel Treeborn decks are misunderstood and a thing I always see tell is that Treeborn decks are too slow. However, people forget that first and foremost it is a control deck. The only speed you really care about is having a {Treeborn Frog} on the field as soon as possible. In this OTK meta, people forget that not every deck needs to close a game in 3 turns. Treeborn set ups the board, gets advantage, allows you to deal with monsters and backrow, and in one or two swings you have game.Also, if speed is a concern, this deck DOES have turn 3/4/5 turn kill options.

### The Good and Bad of the Deck

#### PROS:  

* This deck is well positioned in the meta. All matchups are good matchups except Hazy Flame and Sea Stealth Attack.  
* As there is plenty of Tech Card space you can easily adapt to the constantly shifting meta.  
* With the addition of more strong single tributes and the removal of 3SD this decks has gained a lot of strength.  
* This deck is very pay to win so you show your opponent your bigger wallet.  
* This deck is pay to win and it actually wins, unlike like Darkworlds.  

**UPDATED:**  

Since {Hey, Trunade!} came, the meta has switched to a OTK meta and we have no problem. We can easily deal with decks full of backrow hate since we don't run backrow in the first place.  

#### CONS:  

* It costs quite alot, both in terms of money and time to level up some characters.  
* It is slow so it's not for you if you want quick games or if you don't like slow control decks.  
* You can get OTK'd by some decks if you misplay.  

**UPDATED:**

Now more than before you DO need 3 {Sphere Kuriboh}s.

### How to Play:

You grind early/mid game in order to out resource your opponent and aim for a late game win while your opponent has no answers.  

The deck naturally deals with monsters so you can focus your tributes to deal with backrow, hand disruption,consistency and board presence.  

---

### Core of the Deck

#### Skill:

Ideally play {Restart} or {Beatdown}.

This deck is not really prone to bricks but sometimes you just have very bad hands. You might want Restart for those occasions, even if they don't happen often. You get so much value out of Beatdown, your monsters will run over everything. So, if you feel your build runs smoothly Beatdown is the better option. {Baggy Sleeves} is also a skill you might consider, especially in order to get more Enemy Controllers or Soul Exchanges. Another possible skill to play is {Balance} since you play 6 spells and opening with at least one is important. Check out the Balance statistics in this [guide](/guides/competitive/new-balance-what-you-should-know/).  


#### Tribute Fodder:

[deck](Treeborn Frog;Skreech;Mecha Phantom Beast Hamstrat; Spell Striker)

Ideally you should play 4 monsters for tribute fodder in Restart builds. You might want to increase them to 5 if you run Beatdown and feel the deck is lacking consistency.  

* {Treeborn Frog}  

Dont play less than 3 except if you are running some numbers of Skreech. Then 2 is okay. Frog + ECon take in the Standby Phase is just pure value and you want to start doing it as soon as possible.  

For your 4th and possibly 5th option:  

* {Skreech}
* {Mecha Phantom Beast Hamstrat} 
* {Spell Striker}  

Skreech fetches for Treeborn directly from the deck and always saw play. I feel Skreech is unnecessary and people stopped playing him because the effect triggers on BATTLE destruction. In a meta full of Cyber Angels,Geargia and Sylvans Skreech can be bad.  

Mecha Phantom Beast Hamstrat or Spell Striker as well are totally up to you and your personal preference. Hamstrat gives you a lot of protection, while Striker gives you access to faster plays.  
**Note** Keep in mind Striker clashes with {Angmarl the Fiendish Monarch}.  

##### **Honorable Mentions:**  

[deck](Relinkuriboh;Mystic Piper)  

* {Relinkuriboh}  
* {Mystic Piper}  

#### Spells (6 - 8):

[deck](Enemy Controller; Soul Exchange;)

* {Enemy Controller}
* {Soul Exchange}  

6 slots are filled automatically by Enemy Controller and Soul Exchange. Play 3 of both. You can then go up to probably MAX 8 spells if you feel you want to include some techs/backrow.  

##### **Honorable Mentions:**  

[deck](Monster Gate;Tribute to the Doomed;Dark World Lightning;Super Rush Headlong;Cosmic Cyclone)

* {Monster Gate}  
* {Tribute to the Doomed}  
* {Dark World Lightning} (aka Tribute to the Doomed for backrow)  
* {Super Rush Headlong}  
* {Cosmic Cyclone}  

Monster Gate can be a broken card as well as a terrible option. **IF** you include it, remember you might topdeck into a Treeborn Frog, Hamstrat, Sphere Kuriboh or a monster that loses its effect if it is not summoned via tributing. Alternatively, **ITS BONKERS** when you topdeck Dark Magician of Chaos or other tributes like Kaiser Glider.  

#### Protection:  

[deck](Sphere Kuriboh)

* {Sphere Kuriboh}  

You can't play backrow because it doesn't work well with the Treeborn Frog Engine. Your only viable option is playing some numbers of Sphere Kuriboh.  
**No more** Kuriboh-less Monarchs guys. You have to play 3.    

#### Tribute Monsters:  

Considering 6 Spells and 4 Tribute Fodder Monsters, this leaves us with 10 slots for Tributes.  
Since Treeborn Decks naturally deals with opponent monsters well, we can focus those monsters for other control strategies:  

##### Backrow Hate

[deck](B.E.S. Tetran;Fenghuang)

* {B.E.S. Tetran} 
* {Fenghuang}

Tetran is usually preferred over Fenghuang since it stays on the field and can stall for some turns, while Fenghuang is good for big plays but offers no protection. Play 2 or 3 of them in the numbers you prefer. Try 2 Tetran 1 Feng if you want 3 tributes for backrow hate.

##### Board Control and Presence

[deck](Dark Ruler Ha Des;Kaiser Glider)

Not really needed but you might want some tributes to deal with opponent monsters. Monsters that saw play for this reason are:  

* {Dark Ruler Ha Des} 
* {Kaiser Glider}

Ha Des has good synergy with Angmarl since he is a Fiend, deals with flip effects and other monsters that trigger their effect upon destruction. Glider is our new toy and people are liking him quite a lot. Glider bounces back problematic monsters and can crash against {Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon}, {Red Dragon Ninja}, {Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys} and a bunch of other boss monsters.

##### Hand Disruption

[deck](Dark Red Enchanter;Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch)

* {Dark Red Enchanter}
* {Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch}

Enchanter and Thestalos are the only monster that give us hand distruption plays. Discard is such a powerful effect. You will see people quitting after you hit something they were saving for some big play. Enchanter offers repeatability of the effect over the match and she (yes it is a she) can become quite big if you dont need the discard. Thestalos on the other hand can burn the opponent a bit. Not really needed, but the extra damage could add up to an easy finish.

##### Consistency

[deck](Angmarl the Fiendish Monarch)

* {Angmarl the Fiendish Monarch}

Angmarl fetches for more Enemy Controllers and Soul Exchanges. While it does not impact the board, it does setup up good follow ups and thins the deck. It is highly recommended that you play 2-3.  

##### Other Good Tributes  

[deck](Destiny HERO - Dasher;Dark Magician of Chaos;Invader of Darkness;Chaos Hunter)
 
* {Destiny HERO - Dasher} 
* {Dark Magician of Chaos} 
* {Invader of Darkness}
* {Chaos Hunter}

Dasher is a **Win – Win** card. ALWAYS play it in my opinion.  

If the opponent chooses not to destroy him, you get a 3k beater attacking every turn. If he chooses to send him at the grave, you get a free special summon (you decide when to uses Dasher's effect).  

Dark Magician of Chaos is just overall a good card and we dont mind the 2 tributes so we can include him without problems. Working similar to Angmarl, you can play a Dark Magician of Chaos if you dont have many copies of the Monarch. Top decking Dark Magician of Chaos with Monster Gate or Destiny HERO - Dasher is one of the best plays you can do!  

Chaos Hunter helps a lot the Hazy matchup since Chaos Hunter stops {Beast Rising}. It is also useful in the Cyber Angel matchup if you need to sacrifice something and you don't want to be open to an OTK. If you don't play it in your main 20 it is surely a good side deck card.

### TIPS AND TRICKS:

Remember to toggle **ON** and ECon take opponent monsters during the Standby Phase so you steal them and you get a second Treeborn Frog activation.  
![](/img/assets/ranks/toggle.png)  

Against a deck that swarms the board, try this combo:
1. Soul Exchange
2. Tribute an opponents monster for an ECon take play 
3. Use the taken monster to tribute summon  

This combo is super strong and it is a 3 for 2 that nets you a big monster on the field. Totally not stolen from Gravekeepers.  

If you play {Monster Gate}, always use your opponents monster as the tribute by Soul Exchange or after stealing them with Enemy Controller to get max value out of it.  

You can Soul Exchange and tribute an opponents monster for Dasher, making Soul Exchange a “destroy 1 opponent monster” with no downside.  

Similarly, you can do the same after an ECon take.

### MATCHUPS:

| Ancient Gears | Red-Eyes Zombies | Hazy Flame |
| Gladiator Beasts | Dinos | Cyber Angels |

| Phoenix | Geargias | Sea Stealth Attack |

| Fishes | | |

| Aliens | | |

<br>

##### Matchup Discussion
A short breakdown of key information needed to make the best decisions in each matchup.  

#### Aliens:

If you can set a {Fenghuang} it's basically game. Fenghuang is absurd against Aliens. Not much to fear from them. They may swarm the field but there will be nothing too difficult to deal with. 1800 def from Fenghuang is awesome since only {Alien Overlord} can get over it.  

#### Destiny Heroes:

They don't generally pack protection, ECon take plays are usually how you close games. Not much you have to deal with.  

#### Fishes:  

Like Aliens, Fenghuang makes the matchup very easy. Remember to attack over {Oyster Meister} so they don't get tokens from its effect.  

#### Sylvans:  

Soul Exchange, Sphere Kuriboh and correctly timed ECon take plays can secure you an easy win against Sylvans. If you feel you need even more Sylvan counters, add more Tribute to the Doomed.  

#### Archfiends:

Somehow a 50-50 matchup. If they pack Sphere Kuriboh it might be a bad matchup, otherwise ECon takes are very good. Fenghuang can sometimes hit them too if they are still setting up their board.  

#### Geargias:  

If they start with {Ties of the Brethren} it's going to be difficult but if you can double ECon take you canuse their monster effects against them. It's a fun matchup and can be easily winnable.  

#### Sea Stealth Attack:

One of the few poor matchup recently added in the game, B.E.S. Tetran is probably better than Fenghuang for this matchup. You want to force your opponent to remove their monsters so they clear the board for your OTKs. However, this is a bad matchup.  

#### Ancient Gears:

Ancient Gears have several cards to fear such as {Rare Metalmorph} and {Ancient Gear Golem} that can pierce through a Treeborn Frog. {Ancient Gear Beast} can aslo be annoying as he will negate Treeborn Frogs effect.
Kaiser Glider, Tetran and discard effects are good against Ancient Gears. Generally this is an easy matchup overall.

#### Gladiator Beasts:

They really need their monsters to survive, Soul Exchange and ECon take do most of the job in winning the matchup.  

#### Temple Burn:

Discard and Fenghuang are extremely good against Burn. You don't really care about {Massivemorph}s and {Lava Golem} because of all your tribute monsters. It is up to you whether you want to play around {Destiny Draw} or not. I usually do better if I do not play around it because there isn't much they can draw to auto win against Treeborn.

#### Phoenix:

With no backrow you just do not care about Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys' effect. {Wild Tornado} might be something to watch out for though. Kaiser Glider and discard effects come in handy against Phoenix players. Kaiser Glider especially to crash into Phoenix. Beatdown is bad for us in these matchups.  

#### Hazy Flame:

Try to hit the non-Hazy monsters so they do not get a chance to summon {Hazy Flame Sphynx} unless they draw Soul Exchange. If they do summon Hazy monsters, your only way to win is with Chaos Hunter blocking {Beast Rising.}

#### Cyber Angels:

If you can predict the opponent is playing Cyber Angels, hope for an ECon take play and for them to not OTK you. Piercing from {Cyber Angel Dakini} hurts a lot.  

#### Horus:

If they summon even lvl 6 it's basically gg. Nothing you can really do.

#### Red-Eyes Zombies:

You can out resource them. Deal with {Mirror Wall} and backrow with B.E.S. Tetran, which is a decent stall. If they get fast hands they might just OTK you but it is a winnable matchup. Hamstrat, Kaiser Glider and Chaos hunter help in this matchup.

#### Dinos:

Sometimes you get OTK'd by all the swarm they do, other times you have no problems winning against Dinos. It is quite a 50-50 matchup like Red-Eyes Zombies. Hamstrat is definetly good in this matchup.
