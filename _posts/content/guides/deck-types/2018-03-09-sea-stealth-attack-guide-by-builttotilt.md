### Introduction

Hi there! I go by the name of Built2Tilt and I've been playing Duel Links for just over a year now. I became active in the competitive community about 3 months ago and have written several Duel Links articles for [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/BuilttoTilt) and Duel Links Meta.
   
Since my top 8 performance in [MCS VI](/tournaments/meta-championship-series/6/report/) I've become a Deck Expert for Sea Stealth Attack and a member of the [Top Player Council](https://dlmbeta.netlify.com/top-player-council/). I have a history in the TCG, placing top 16 in UK Nationals 2016 and topping several popular community events such as CCG.

### Overview

The meteoric rise of {Sea Stealth Attack} as the most dominant Deck in the game was swiftly followed by a huge decline in its usage statistics in tournaments. The archetype has had a hard time adapting to the new meta which is now focused more on hard removal and effect negation, and now faces stiff new competition for its spot in the top tiers in the form of [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/) and [Geargias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/). All of this aside, Sea Stealth Attack is still an incredibly strong Deck with many favourable match ups in the meta and if built right it can be a devastating force in tournament formats.

This guide will explain why {Sea Stealth Attack} is such a strong card, how you can counter it, the different ways you can build your Deck around it, how to build with the meta in mind and how the Deck fares against common match ups.

### The Card

{Sea Stealth Attack} has 3 effects:

1. On activation, you can activate one {Umi} directly from your hand or Graveyard. This effect happens only once when Sea Stealth Attack is first activated. Because {A Legendary Ocean} is always counted as Umi it synergises with this effect.
2. If Umi is face up on the field (your opponent's field included) then any time a water Monster who's original level was 5 or higher battles, the Monster it battles is destroyed at the start of the Damage Step. This means that face down Monsters will not be flipped face up ({Sylvan Komushroomo}), and effects that activate in the Damage Step such as {D.D. Warrior} will not be able to activate. If both you and your opponent control Sea Stealth Attack, and your water Monsters who's original level was 5 or higher do battle, both Monsters will be destroyed.
3. Once per turn you can Banish any face up water Monster you control (as a [cost](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Cost)) until the End Phase: this turn, face up Spell and Trap cards you control cannot be destroyed by card effects. This effect works similarly to {Interdimensional Matter Transporter}, allowing you to chain to effects such as {Enemy Controller} and keep your Monster safe.

It is important to note that for both the second and third effects, Sea Stealth Attack needs to be face up on the field to activate and resolve them. This means that the first time you flip it up, you will not be able to activate the second or third effect in the same chain. This is why many players opt to activate it in the Standby Phase so they can chain the third effect to any removal effects.

The card is so strong because it makes your Monsters very hard to deal with, both in battle and with hard removal, on top of the fact that it has inherent protection from destruction by card effects. When you combine this with the strong control effects of the high level water Monsters that abuse it like {Citadel Whale} and {The Legendary Fisherman II} it becomes incredibly difficult to stop.

But no card is without its drawbacks and {Sea Stealth Attack} is no exception.

### Dealing With Sea Stealth Attack

1. If you can force your opponent to Banish their Monster with Sea Stealth Attack you can then get a clear shot at their life points. This is best done with cards like {Storm}, {Enemy Controller} and {Geargiattacker}/{Geargianchor}, cards that threaten to remove cards from your opponent's field.
2. As mentioned above, it must be face up and already active to activate the second and third effects of the card. This means that if you can chain a destruction effect (such as {Wild Tornado}) to the activation of Sea Stealth Attack, you can destroy the card before it's effect can resolve
3. Cards that do not destroy but remove cards from the field, such as {Cosmic Cyclone} and {Abyss Soldier} can both bypass Sea Stealth Attack's protection and remove it from the field.
4. As Sea Stealth Attack's battle effect activates in the Battle Phase, it is susceptible to being countered by {Anti-Magic Arrows}.
5. {Super Rush Headlong} is a great counter, as it takes priority over Sea Stealth Attack's destruction effect. You will be able to Banish your Monster and protect it from destruction, but this will leave you open for attacks.

### The Variants

First I'd like to briefly outline the different directions one can take when building around Sea Stealth Attack, and some of their pros and cons.

<br>

#### Mythic Depths vs Restart

These are the two most prominent skills for the Deck, and they have their advantages and disadvantages.

{Mythic Depths} lets you start the Duel with {Umi} on the field, effectively giving you access to one piece of your combo without having to draw it. It also means that you don’t have to spend several Deck slots on {Warrior of Atlantis} and {A Legendary Ocean}, freeing up the space for other options. It’s very good for Decks that rely on using low level Monsters to turbo Summon {Citadel Whale} to the field, as the level reduction of A Legendary Ocean doesn’t do much for that strategy and you gain much more value from not having to worry about drawing your Field Spell.
  
However, Mythic Depths leaves you much weaker to {Cosmic Cyclone}, unless you opt to play {A Legendary Ocean} on top of your {Umi}. Consider that this can affect the consistency of the Deck, as you rarely want to see A Legendary Ocean in your hand outside of needing it to come back against a Cosmic Cyclone.
  
{Restart} is the go-to skill for {That Grass Looks Greener} and "5 Star Spam" variants, as these Decks rely on hard drawing their power cards like Grass and Sea Stealth Attack. These Decks are often less susceptible to {Cosmic Cyclone} because they play multiple {A Legendary Ocean}, however they tend to suffer from consistency issues because they are inherently combo based Decks that require 3 cards to go off properly. The consistency issue is especially prominent in the Grass variants, which are forced to play 30 cards.
  
Right now Mythic Depths is definitely the best skill to go with right now, as it adds to consistency of the Deck without taking up Deck space. Considering Cosmic Cyclone is not as popular as it once was, Mythic Depths is a much safer choice than it used to be.

<br>

#### Fishes Sea Stealth Attack

This build uses {Oyster Meister} and {Hammer Shark} as the tribute engine for {Citadel Whale}, which gives it access to {Beautunaful Princess} and {Golden Flying Fish} in the Main/Side Deck.

**Skill: {Mythic Depths}**

##### Core Cards
- {Oyster Meister}
- {Hammer Shark}
- {Abyss Soldier}
- {Beautunaful Princess}
- {Citadel Whale}

##### Example Deck

[deck:Mythic Depths](Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Hammer Shark; Beautunaful Princess; Oyster Meister; Oyster Meister; Golden Flying Fish; Parallel Twister; Parallel Twister; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Paleozoic Canadia; Fish Depth Charge; Sea Stealth Attack; Powerful Rebirth; Powerful Rebirth)

**Pros:**
- More resilient against common side Deck options such as {Cosmic Cyclone} and {Super Rush Headlong}, as it can opt to side out the {Citadel Whale} engine entirely.
- Has consistent access to removal with not only {Abyss Soldier} but also {Golden Flying Fish}, which is searchable via {Beautunaful Princess}.
**Cons:**
- Less consistent at Summoning Citadel Whale, as the Whale engine has to be cut back to make room for other cards.

<br>

#### 5 Star Spam

This build tends to focus around {The The Legendary Fisherman II}, {Mecha Sea-Dragon Plesion} and {B.E.S. Crystal Core} utilising either the {Balance} or {Restart} Skill to increase the chances of pulling a Level 5 Water Monster, {A Legendary Ocean} and {Sea Stealth Attack} in the opening hand.

**Skill: {Balance}/{Restart}**

##### Core Cards

- {The Legendary Fisherman II}
- {B.E.S. Crystal Core}/{Mecha Sea Dragon Plesion}/{Shark Cruiser}
- {Warrior of Atlantis}
- {A Legendary Ocean}
- {Sea Stealth Attack}

##### Example Deck

[deck:Restart](The Legendary Fisherman II; The Legendary Fisherman II; The Legendary Fisherman II; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Citadel Whale; Warrior of Atlantis; Warrior of Atlantis; Warrior of Atlantis; Shark Cruiser; Shark Cruiser; Shark Cruiser; Parallel Twister; Parallel Twister; A Legendary Ocean; A Legendary Ocean; Sea Stealth Attack; Sea Stealth Attack; Sea Stealth Attack)

**Pros:**
- The Deck is hard to stop once it gets rolling, as it can apply the constant pressure of practically invincible Monsters backed up by {Sea Stealth Attack} which all have strong control effects in their own right.
- The stat line of the Monsters is well above average, sitting at 2200-2500 ATK for Monsters that can be normal Summoned for no cost when {A Legendary Ocean} is active. This can be hard for some Decks to deal with, even without Sea Stealth Attack.

**Cons:**
- There is absolutely no way for the Deck to get to its win condition (Sea Stealth Attack) except by hard drawing it. This means that there will be a lot of Duels where you just don't see Sea Stealth Attack, and lose because of it.
- Consistency is the main Achille's heel of the Deck as you are relying on a 3 card combo, and if you don't see A Legendary Ocean, you are left with a Deck full of level 5 Monsters that can't be Summoned at all.

<br>

#### That Grass Looks Greener

The 30 card version of the Deck focuses on using {That Grass Looks Greener} to dump resources into the Graveyard in order to Summon Citadel Whale. There are many cards and engines that are used to Summon 2 water Monsters onto the field in order to tribute for Citadel Whale's effect, and these include; Cloudian Turbulence, Lekunga, Gishki Beast, Hammer Shark, Fishborg Planter and Feast of the Wild LV5.

**Skill: {Restart}**

##### Core Cards
- {Citadel Whale}
- {Warrior of Atlantis}
- {Fishborg Planter}
- {A Legendary Ocean}
- {That Grass Looks Greener}
- {Sea Stealth Attack}

##### Example Deck

[deck:Restart](Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Gishki Chain; Gishki Chain; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Warrior of Atlantis; Warrior of Atlantis; Warrior of Atlantis; Hammer Shark; Hammer Shark; Hammer Shark; Beautunaful Princess; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; That Grass Looks Greener; That Grass Looks Greener; That Grass Looks Greener; Parallel Twister; A Legendary Ocean; A Legendary Ocean; A Legendary Ocean; Paleozoic Canadia; Paleozoic Canadia; Paleozoic Canadia; Sea Stealth Attack; Sea Stealth Attack)

**Pros:**
- These builds can be extremely explosive if they open up with {That Grass Looks Greener} and mill well. It effectively acts as 3 cards from your combo, because {Citadel Whale} and {Fishborg Planter} can be Summoned from the Graveyard, while {A Legendary Ocean} can be activated from the Graveyard with {Sea Stealth Attack}.
- Playing 30 cards gives you the flexibility of fitting several engines into your Deck. This means that even if you don't open with Grass, you will often have a way to make a play to get you closer to Citadel Whale.

**Cons:**
- Playing 30 cards makes your Deck less consistent by default. It's hard to speak broadly because there are so many sub-variants of "Grass Sea Stealth Attack" Decks, but not drawing Grass puts you at a big disadvantage against a 20 card Deck because they will generally be drawing into their combos faster than you will.
- Drawing multiple Grass is terrible. This Deck in particular has no discard outlets other than {Abyss Soldier}, so a dead Grass will often sit in your hand for the whole Duel, effectively putting you at -1 card in terms of advantage.

<br>

#### Gishki 

One of the more consistent incarnations of the Deck, this build focuses on using {Gishki Chain} to re-order the Deck and manipulate your {Fishborg Planter} mills to dig for {Citadel Whale} faster.

**Skill: {Mythic Depths}**

##### Core Cards
- {Abyss Soldier}
- {Citadel Whale}
- {Gishki Chain}
- {Fishborg Planter}
- {Powerful Rebirth}
- {Sea Stealth Attack}

##### Example Deck

[deck:Mythic Depths](Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Gishki Chain; Gishki Chain; Gishki Chain; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Parallel Twister; Parallel Twister; Paleozoic Canadia; Paleozoic Canadia; Paleozoic Canadia; Sea Stealth Attack; Powerful Rebirth; Powerful Rebirth)

**Pros:**
- Very consistent. By manipulating the Deck with {Gishki Chain} you can re-arrange the top of your Deck to ensure you see {Citadel Whale} as quickly as possible.
- This variant utilises {Fishborg Planter} to it's full potential, as Gishki Chain allows you to play a high number of tech cards.

**Cons:**
- Has limited options for Summoning {Citadel Whale} on turn 1.
- Has an especially bad [Cyber Angels](/tier-list/deck-types/cyber-angels/) matchup, as your first turn usually consists of Summoning only one Monster.

<br>

#### Shark Turbo

Similar to the [Grass variant](#that-grass-looks-greener), this build attempts to get {Citadel Whale} on to the field as quickly as possible, but with 20 cards. The build that I personally crafted and piloted to a top 8 finish in [MCS VI](/tournaments/meta-championship-series/6/report/) is in essence very similar to the [Gishki build](#gishki) except this Deck uses {Hammer Shark} or {Abyss Soldier} + {Fishborg Planter} to Summon Whale on turn 1.

**Skill: {Mythic Depths}**

##### Core Cards
- {Abyss Soldier}
- {Citadel Whale}
- {Fishborg Planter}
- {Hammer Shark}
- {Sea Stealth Attack}

##### Example Deck

[deck:Mythic Depths](Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Gishki Chain; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Hammer Shark; Hammer Shark; Hammer Shark; Beautunaful Princess; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Paleozoic Canadia; Sea Stealth Attack; Powerful Rebirth; Powerful Rebirth)

**Pros:**
- Extremely aggressive and versatile, this Deck can close out games incredibly quickly with explosive plays using {Hammer Shark} and {Enemy Controller}, or control the board with {Abyss Soldier} and {Citadel Whale}.
- The ability to put out Whale on turn 1 is too much for many popular Decks, such as [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/) and [Aliens](/tier-list/deck-types/aliens/) to handle. Opening with Whale + Hammer Shark + {Fishborg Planter} is effectively game over against most Decks.

**Cons:**
- While the Deck can function without Citadel Whale, it becomes considerably less powerful if all of your Whales are on the bottom of your Deck.
- {Fishborg Planter} is extremely powerful, and while you can manipulate the odds by stacking your Deck with Monsters and searching out your Spells and Traps, you will still miss your effect sometimes and it will cost you games. To that effect, it may be wise to tech one or two {Gishki Chain} in to ensure a Fishborg hit at a crucial moment.

<br>

### Matchups

#### [Geargias](/tier-list/deck-types/geargias/) 
This Deck is probably the main reason that Sea Stealth Attack has fallen off so hard recently, as the {Ties of the Brethren} combo can easily break a fully established {Citadel Whale} board and easily OTK. But it's not all doom and gloom; {Umi} provides a big 400 ATK point swing making it hard for their Monsters to run over yours in battle, meaning they will need to burn back row every turn to keep their Monsters alive in battle which allows you to pressure their board (especially if they don't open with Ties). 
   
{Abyss Soldier} is vital for targeting {Geargiattacker}/{Geargianchor} and setting them back a turn. Trap cards like {Paleozoic Canadia} and {Fish Depth Charge} synergise well with the Deck and can be used to counter Ties. Going second against the Ties combo will almost certainly result in your loss but that can be said about any Deck in the meta, and Sea Stealth Attack actually has a lot more room to fit in Ties counters than other Decks. This one is quite a toss up, with defensive variants of Sea Stealth Attack being able to handle a Ties onslaught better than turbo variants.

---

#### [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/) 
{Mask Change} opens up incredibly explosive OTK plays for this Deck making it hard to deal with in the early game, but without {Cosmic Cyclone} Heroes have a hard time dealing with an early {Citadel Whale}. {Destiny HERO - Celestial} has the ability to destroy {Umi} on attack declaration, but this can be played around by holding off on activating your {Sea Stealth Attack} until the end of the Battle Phase, or by getting two Monsters on the field. {Abyss Soldier} is great at dealing with an early {Destiny HERO - Dangerous} play. {Masked HERO Anki} can bypass your battle protection and attack directly, so keep this in mind when managing your Life Points.

---

#### [Sylvans](/tier-list/deck-types/sylvans/) 
This match up is quite favourable, as {Abyss Soldier} forces them to go aggressive with {Sylvan Marshalleaf} or risk the two hit knockout. With {Ultimate Providence} being somewhat ubiquitous in Sylvan builds one has to be careful when using Monster effects. {Citadel Whale} + {Sea Stealth Attack} backed with an {Enemy Controller} is able to effectively shut the Sylvan player out of the game, as they will not be able to break your board with {Rose Lover} + {Sylvan Hermitree}. 
   
{Parallel Twister} is incredibly valuable in this match up, as it allows you to deal with a face down {Sylvan Komushroomo} through {Divine Wrath}/{Ultimate Providence}, and can even be used to destroy the Counter Trap itself. Remember to play around {Grit} if they are using it, as going for an OTK can often lead to you draining your resources and losing the next turn. When facing {Grit}, focus on saving your resources and grinding out as much advantage as possible.

---

#### [Archfiends](/tier-list/deck-types/archfiends/) 
This one can be tricky as they have {Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror} to force the Banish, and if they get the Emperor + {Archfiend Empress} lock up they will be able to bypass your {Sea Stealth Attack} destruction. But they can be slow to set up and an early {Citadel Whale} can be a quick ticket to victory. As usual {Abyss Soldier} is the MVP, being able to keep Monsters out of the Graveyard and out or reach of {Call of the Archfiend}. 
   
Try to get 2 Monsters out as quickly as possible to protect from the inevitable force Banish from the Emperor. {Paleozoic Canadia} is very good in this match up, shutting down their Monster effects for a full turn and being able to revive itself when they activate their Trap cards to block a potential OTK.

---

#### [Aliens](/tier-list/deck-types/aliens/) 
{Citadel Whale} is incredibly strong here, being able to flat out negate roughly 8-10 core cards in the Deck. {Sea Stealth Attack} is also very hard for them to deal with as they rely on the Battle Phase to deal with Monsters, and Sea Stealth Attack is the king of the Battle Phase. You won't always be able to get Whale out on turn 1, and when you can't it is advisable to play slowly and defensively until you can make a big push. {Abyss Soldier} with Sea Stealth Attack can usually control the board long enough for you to get your Whale out. You should be winning this matchup 80% of the time.

---

#### [Red-Eyes Zombies](/tier-list/deck-types/red-eyes-zombies/) 
This Deck is heavily reliant on {Enemy Controller} and {Storm}, and both {Citadel Whale} and {Sea Stealth Attack} are fantastic counters to those cards. This match up is also highly in your favour, but it is not impossible to lose. If they open with {Gozuki}, {Red-Eyes Spirit} and Enemy Controller and you are unable to Summon a Whale, you could be in trouble. 
   
When you do have Whale out, they rely heavily on forcing the Banish with Storm, so try to get your second Monster onto the field as quickly as possible to protect against this strategy. {Abyss Soldier} bouncing a {Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon} can be incredibly disruptive. **Pro Tip:** If you target {Samurai Skull} with {Abyss Soldier} it will trigger Skull's effect to Special Summon a Zombie Monster from the Deck - DO NOT DO THIS!

---

#### [Cyber Angels](/tier-list/deck-types/cyber-angels/)
One of your worst matchups. They have the ability to OTK on turn 2 through {Citadel Whale} + {Sea Stealth Attack}, which no other Deck can do. Also, their Ritual Spells can be used to protect against Sea Stealth Attack. Going second gives you a much better chance of winning against Cyber Angels, and the fact that we can put 2 Monsters up in one turn slightly protects against {Cyber Angel Dakini}. If you can get multiple Sea Stealth Attack on board with Whale, your opponent will have to Banish one Ritual Spell per copy of Sea Stealth Attack to protect their Monster from destruction. 
   
{Abyss Soldier} can win the game on it's own if your opponent overextends into a first turn {Saffira, Queen of Dragons} or Dakini play. {Enemy Controller} allows for quick OTK's and great protection against Dakini. More defensive builds that pack tech cards like {Paleozoic Canadia} have a much better matchup than the turbo builds.

---

#### Mirror Match 
This one is tricky to describe because there are so many variants. [5 Star Spam](#5-star-spam) and [Grass](#that-grass-looks-greener) builds do well here because they have the ability to constantly Summon a high level water Monster every turn, but the sheer consistency of the [Shark Turbo](#shark-turbo) and [Gishki](#gishki) variants somewhat makes up for this. It often comes down to who can get their Whale on the field first, and who can keep Summoning it back to the field after it gets destroyed by Sea Stealth Attack.
