***BuiltToTilt has always been a highly competitive player, and recently reached Top 8 at [MCS VI](/tournaments/meta-championship-series/6/) with a Sea Stealth Attack deck***

### Introduction

{Sea Stealth Attack} is an incredibly powerful card but surprisingly the deck did not achieve the instant success that people thought it would. Many different builds were conceived, and few saw any success on the tournament circuit on the first week of release. Nonetheless, Sea Stealth Attack was able to take multiple spots in the Top 32 of the [MCS VI](/tournaments/meta-championship-series/6/) and has since become quite a popular KoG deck in the competitive community.

In this guide I will explain why Sea Stealth Attack is such a strong card, how you can counter it, the different ways you can build your deck around it, how I personally chose to build the deck and how the deck fares against common match ups.

---

### The Card

Sea Stealth Attack has 3 effects;

1. *On activation, you can activate 1 {Umi} directly from your hand or graveyard.*  This effect happens only once when Sea Stealth Attack is first activated. Because {A Legendary Ocean} is always counted as Umi, it synergises with this effect
    
2. *If Umi is face up on the field (your opponent's field included) then any time a Water monster who's original level was 5 or higher battles, the monster it battles is destroyed at the start of the Damage Step.* This means that face down monsters will not be flipped face up, and effects that activate in the damage step such as {D.D. Warrior} will not be able to activate. If both you and your opponent control Sea Stealth Attack, and your Water monsters who's original level was 5 or higher do battle, both monsters will be destroyed
    
3. *Once per turn you can banish any face up water monster you control (as a cost) until the end phase: this turn, face up Spell and Trap cards you control cannot be destroyed by card effects.* This effect works similarly to {Interdimensional Matter Transporter}, allowing you to chain to effects such as {Enemy Controller} to keep your monster safe

It is important to note that for both the second and third effects, Sea Stealth Attack needs to be face up on the field to activate and resolve them. This means that the first time you flip it up, you will not be able to activate the second or third effect in the same chain. This is why many players opt to activate Sea Stealth Attack in the Standby Phase so they can chain the third effect to any removal effects.

The card is so strong because it makes your monsters very hard to deal with, both in battle and with hard removal, on top of the fact that it has inherent protection from destruction by card effects. When you combine this with the strong control effects of the high level water monsters that abuse it like {Citadel Whale} and {The Legendary Fisherman II} it becomes incredibly difficult to stop.

But no card is without it's drawbacks, and Sea Stealth Attack is no exception.

---

### Dealing with Sea Stealth Attack

1. If you can force your opponent to banish their monster with Sea Stealth Attack you can then get a clear shot at their Life Points. This is best done with cards like {Storm}, Enemy Controller and {Brainwashing Beam}, cards that threaten to remove cards from your opponent's field

2. As mentioned above, Sea Stealth Attack must be face up and already active to activate the second and third effects of the card. This means that if you can chain a destruction effect (such as {Wild Tornado}) to the activation of Sea Stealth Attack, you can destroy the card before it's effect can resolve

3. Cards that do not destroy but remove cards from the field, such as {Cosmic Cyclone} and {Abyss Soldier} can both bypass Sea Stealth Attack's protection and remove it from the field

4. As Sea Stealth Attack's battle effect activates in the Battle Phase, it is susceptible to being countered by {Anti-Magic Arrows}

5. {Super Rush Headlong} is a great counter, as it takes priority over Sea Stealth Attack's destruction effect. You will be able to banish your monster and protect it from destruction, but this will leave you open for attacks

### The Variants

First I'd like to briefly outline the different directions one can take when building around Sea Stealth Attack, and some of their pros and cons.

**{Mythic Depths} VS. {Restart}**

These are the two most prominent skills for the deck, and they have their advantages and disadvantages.

Mythic Depths lets you start the duel with Umi on the field, effectively giving you access to one piece of your combo without having to draw it. It also means that you don’t have to spend several deck slots on {Warrior of Atlantis} and A Legendary Ocean, freeing up the space for other options. It’s very good for decks that rely on using low level monsters to turbo summon Citadel Whale to the field, as the level reduction of A Legendary Ocean doesn’t do much for that strategy and you gain much more value from not having to worry about drawing your field spell.

However, Mythic Depths leaves you much weaker to Cosmic Cyclone, unless you opt to play A Legendary Ocean on top of your Umi. However, this can affect the consistency of the deck, as you rarely want to see A Legendary Ocean in your hand outside of needing it to come back against a Cosmic Cyclone.

Restart is the go-to skill for {That Grass Looks Greener} and 5 Star Spam variants, as these decks rely on hard drawing their power cards like That Grass Looks Greener and Sea Stealth Attack. These decks are often less susceptible to Cosmic Cyclone because they play multiple A Legendary Ocean, however they tend to suffer from consistency issues because they are inherently combo based decks that require 3 cards to go off properly.

When building your Sea Stealth Attack deck, ask yourself these questions:

1. Can you afford to play multiple copies of A Legendary Ocean in your deck?
2. Does your deck benefit from playing A Legendary Ocean? Or does it benefit from having more deck space?
3. Do you rely heavily on an unsearchable card to win? (Sea Stealth Attack, That Grass Looks Greener)

And you should have your answer as to what skill to play.

### 5 Star Spam

This build tends to focus around The Legendary Fisherman II, {Mecha Sea Dragon Plesion} and {B.E.S. Crystal Core}, utilising either the Balance or Restart skill to increase the chances of pulling a Level 5 Water monster, A Legendary Ocean and Sea Stealth Attack in the opening hand.

**Core Cards**

[deck](The Legendary Fisherman II; B.E.S. Crystal Core; Mecha Sea Dragon Plesion; Warrior of Atlantis; A Legendary Ocean; Sea Stealth Attack)

**Example Deck List**

[deck: Restart](The Legendary Fisherman II; The Legendary Fisherman II; The Legendary Fisherman II; B.E.S. Crystal Core; B.E.S. Crystal Core; B.E.S. Crystal Core; Warrior of Atlantis; Warrior of Atlantis; Warrior of Atlantis; Mecha Sea Dragon Plesion; Mecha Sea Dragon Plesion; Mecha Sea Dragon Plesion; A Legendary Ocean; A Legendary Ocean; A Legendary Ocean; Sea Stealth Attack; Sea Stealth Attack; Sea Stealth Attack; Wall of Disruption; Wall of Disruption)

**Pros**

The deck is hard to stop once it gets rolling, as it can apply the constant pressure of practically invincible monsters backed up by Sea Stealth Attack which all have strong control effects in their own right.
    
The stat line of the monsters is well above average, sitting at 2200-2500 for monsters that can be normal summoned for no cost when A Legendary Ocean is active. This can be hard for some decks to deal with, even without Sea Stealth Attack.

**Cons**

There is absolutely no way for the deck to get to it's win condition Sea Stealth Attack except by hard drawing it. This means that there will be a lot of duels where you just don't see Sea Stealth Attack, and lose because of it.
    
Consistency is the main Achilles' heel of the deck as you are relying on a 3 card combo, and if you don't see A Legendary Ocean, you are left with a deck full of level 5 monsters that can't be summoned at all.

---

### That Grass Looks Greener

The 30 card version of the deck focuses on using That Grass Looks Greener to dump resources into the graveyard in order to summon Citadel Whale. There are many cards and engines that are used to summon 2 Water monsters onto the field in order to tribute for Citadel Whale's effect, and these include; {Cloudian - Turbulence}, {Lekunga}, {Gishki Beast}, {Hammer Shark}, {Fishborg Planter} and {Feast of the Wild LV5}.

**Core Cards**

[deck](Citadel Whale; Warrior of Atlantis; Fishborg Planter; A Legendary Ocean; That Grass Looks Greener; Sea Stealth Attack)

**Example Deck List**

[deck:Restart](Gishki Chain; Gishki Chain; Gishki Chain; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Warrior of Atlantis; Warrior of Atlantis; Warrior of Atlantis; Gishki Ariel; Gishki Ariel; Gishki Ariel; Gishki Beast; Gishki Beast; Gishki Beast; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; That Grass Looks Greener; That Grass Looks Greener; That Grass Looks Greener; A Legendary Ocean; A Legendary Ocean; A Legendary Ocean; Sea Stealth Attack; Sea Stealth Attack; Sea Stealth Attack)

**Pros**

These builds can be extremely explosive if they open up with That Grass Looks Greener and mill well. It effectively acts as 3 cards from your combo, because Citadel Whale and Fishborg Planter can be summoned from the graveyard, while A Legendary Ocean can be activated from the graveyard with Sea Stealth Attack.
    
Playing 30 cards gives you the flexibility of fitting several engines into your deck. This means that even if you don't open with {That Grass Looks Greener}, you will often have a way to make a play to get you closer to Citadel Whale.

**Cons**

Playing 30 cards makes your deck less consistent by default. It's hard to speak broadly because there are so many sub-variants of Grass SSA decks , but not drawing That Grass Looks Greener puts you at a big disadvantage against a 20 card deck because they will generally be drawing into their combo's faster than you will.
    
Drawing multiple That Grass Looks Greener is terrible. This deck in particular has no discard outlets other than Abyss Soldier, so a dead That Grass Looks Greener will often sit in your hand for the whole duel, effectively putting you at -1 cards in terms of advantage.

### Evigishki

This build focuses on using {Evigishki Tetrogre} to dump Fishborg Planter or Citadel Whale on turn 1 in order to set up a quick Sea Stealth Attack play, and gains huge value from {Gishki Chain} by using it's search effect not only to gain ritual searches but to reorder your deck to ensure Fishborg Planter hits a water monster.

**Core Cards**

[deck](Evigishki Tetrogre; Evigishki Mind Augus; Gishki Chain; Citadel Whale; Fishborg Planter; Gishki Aquamirror; Sea Stealth Attack)

**Example Deck List**

[deck:Mythic Depths](Evigishki Mind Augus; Evigishki Mind Augus; Evigishki Mind Augus; Evigishki Tetrogre; Evigishki Tetrogre; Evigishki Tetrogre; Gishki Chain; Gishki Chain; Gishki Chain; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Citadel Whale; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Gishki Aquamirror; Gishki Aquamirror; Gishki Aquamirror; Sea Stealth Attack; Sea Stealth Attack)

**Pros**

{Evigishki Mind Augus} and {Gishki Aquamirror} give the deck a lot of durability, in a similar sense to Gladiator Beasts. Because Gishki Aquamirror can shuffle itself into the deck to put a ritual from your graveyard back into your hand, and Evigishki Mind Augus can shuffle 5 cards back from either player's graveyard into the deck. This gives you a stellar match up against decks that rely on milling you out as their win condition and a lot of flexibility in recycling your resources in general.
    
The deck is surprisingly consistent as you almost always have access to a high level water monster and you can search Citadel Whale directly from your deck with Evigishki Tetrogre which in turn can search Sea Stealth Attack. You can also use Fishborg Planter way more reliably due to Gishki Chain allowing you to re-order the top of your deck.

**Cons**

You are overly reliant on Mythic Depths for Umi, making you incredibly vulnerable to a single Cosmic Cyclone. You can offset this weakness by playing one A Legendary Ocean, but bear in mind this will affect your consistency more than other builds, because rituals are inherently combo based.

---

### Gishki

Not to be confused with the Evigishki variant, this build does not ritual summon. Instead it focuses on manipulating the deck with Gishki Chain and {Gishki Ariel} and using {Gishki Beast} to summon 2 monster to tribute for Citadel Whale, while using Abyss Soldier to control the field.

**Core Cards**

[deck](Abyss Soldier; Citadel Whale; Gishki Ariel; Gishki Chain; Gishki Beast; Sea Stealth Attack)

**Example Deck List**

[deck: Mythic Depths](Gishki Chain; Gishki Chain; Gishki Chain; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Gishki Ariel; Gishki Ariel; Gishki Ariel; Gishki Beast; Gishki Beast; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Sea Stealth Attack; Sea Stealth Attack)

**Pros**

Very good at generating advantage slowly and manipulating the deck with Gishki Ariel and Gishki Chain. You can manipulate the top of your deck to ensure you get a hit for Fishborg Planter which is incredibly powerful (although not quite as good as in the Evigishki variant)
    
The ability to summon Citadel Whale consistently allows you to easily search for Sea Stealth Attack, allowing you easy access to your power plays.

**Cons**

Has limited options for summoning Citadel Whale on turn 1, meaning you will often fall prey to faster variants of the deck such as Grass and 5 Star Turbo.
    
Gishki Beast is very useful late in the game, but it requires graveyard set-up and can be dead weight in the early stages.
    
Has an especially bad Cyber Angel match up, as your first turn always consists of summoning only one monster.

---

### Shark Turbo

Similar to the Grass variant, this build attempts to get Citadel Whale on to the field as quickly as possible, but with 20 cards. The build that I personally crafted and piloted to a top 8 finish in MCS VI is in essence very similar to the Gishki build except this deck uses Hammer Shark or Abyss Soldier + Fishborg Planter to summon Citadel Whale on turn 1.

**Core Cards**

[deck](Abyss Soldier; Citadel Whale; Fishborg Planter; Hammer Shark; Beautunaful Princess; Sea Stealth Attack)

**Pros**

Extremely aggressive and versatile, this deck can close out games incredibly quickly with explosive plays using Hammer Shark and Enemy Controller, or control the board with Abyss Soldier and Citadel Whale.
    
The ability to put out Citadel Whale on turn 1 is too much for many popular decks, such as Gladiator Beasts and Alien to handle. Opening with Citadel Whale + Hammer Shark + Fishborg Planter is effectively game over against most decks.

**Cons**

While the deck can function without Citadel Whale, it becomes considerably less powerful if they are on the bottom of your deck.
    
Fishborg Planter is extremely powerful, and while you can manipulate the odds by stacking your deck with monsters and searching out your Spells and Traps, you will still miss your effect sometimes. And it will cost you games. To that effect, it may be wise to tech one or two Gishki Chain in to ensure a Fishborg Planter hit at a crucial moment.

**Example Deck List - My Build**

[deck: Mythic Depths](Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Abyss Soldier; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Citadel Whale; Warrior of Atlantis; Hammer Shark; Hammer Shark; Hammer Shark; Beautunaful Princess; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; Fishborg Planter; A Legendary Ocean; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Sea Stealth Attack; Sea Stealth Attack)

***3x Abyss Soldier***
This card plays not only a utility but also an engine role in the deck, and I'll briefly go over the 3 card combo that gets Citadel Whale out on turn 1: 
- Summon Abyss Soldier
- Activate effect, discarding Fishborg Planter, targeting Umi
- Activate Fishborg Planter, hopefully mill a Water monster
- Tribute Abyss Soldier and Fishborg Planter for Citadel Whale, search Sea Stealth Attack from deck

In addition to this, Abyss Soldier applies great offensive pressure even when we don't have access to Citadel Whale. Going second it can really stun your opponent, as some decks only have the means of summoning one monster per turn (like Gladiator Beasts for example) and these decks have a lot of trouble dealing with Abyss Soldier. It is also your go to out for big boss monsters such as {Saffira, Queen of Dragons} and {Cyber Angel Dakini}.

***3x Citadel Whale***
The heart and soul of the deck, this will be your boss monster and your win condition most of the time. The effect to negate targeting effects is extremely valuable in this meta full of cards like Enemy Controller and "A" Cell Recombination. The summoning condition is not too difficult to achieve, as there are many ways of getting two water monsters on to the field and the fact that it can be summoned from the graveyard makes it even better. However, the icing on the cake is the fact that it can search Sea Stealth Attack directly from your deck, bypassing the consistency issues of some of the other builds. If you successfully summon an early Citadel Whale, you should win that game.

***3x Hammer Shark***
The speed engine of the deck. This is the card that allows you to Summon Citadel Whale + an additional Water monster on your first turn, which is the board that you want to see every game. This is because many decks have ways to force you to banish your Citadel Whale with Sea Stealth Attack (which can leave you vulnerable to an OTK) so if you are able to summon another monster, you are much more insulated against these aggressive kind of plays because you can banish your second monster instead of the Citadel Whale. The Hammer Shark Combo is very similar to the Abyss Soldier combo but better because you end with an extra monster and goes as such:

- Summon Hammer Shark (using {Beautunaful Princess} if need be)
- Activate effect, summon Fishborg Planter (or Beautunaful Princess for Fishborg Planter)
- Tribute both monsters to summon Citadel Whale, search Sea Stealth Attack
- Activate Fishborg Planter in the graveyard to re-summon itself 
- End with Citadel Whale, Fishborg Planter, Sea Stealth Attack and 1 card in hand (going first)

 Hammer Shark is also extremely useful for enabling early OTK's in conjunction with Enemy Controller.

***3x Fishborg Planter***
This is the card that makes this variant viable in the first place. Fishborg Planter takes one card off the top of the deck and puts it in the graveyard to activate it's effect, which is extremely useful because Citadel Whale can be summoned from the graveyard with it's own effect. This makes Fishborg Planter the best way you have to get to your Citadel Whale if you don't open it in your first hand. Fishborg Planter is phenomenal not only because it digs for Citadel Whale and enables first turn Citadel Whale plays but also because of the recursion that it offers. Once you have Citadel Whale and Fishborg Planter in the graveyard, you can effectively turn any single water monster into a Citadel Whale by summoning Fishborg Planter from the graveyard and then summoning Citadel Whale. Fishborg Planter is the core engine of your deck and the card that will be enabling your power plays most of the time, and it is the main reason why the deck operates with such a high monster count.

***1x Beautunaful Princess***
One of the most versatile cards in the deck, this card can be Hammer Shark or Fishborg Planter, depending on your hand. It is inferior to Fishborg Planter in some situations (it doesn't combo well with Abyss Soldier, for example) but for the most part this card greatly boosts the consistency of you being able to pull off your best turn 1 play.

***1x Warrior of Atlantis***
As mentioned in the skill section above, relying on Mythic Depths for Umi can leave you vulnerable to Cosmic Cyclone, so to offset that I opted to run a single copy of Warrior of Atlantis, along with a single copy of A Legendary Ocean. This means that even if a smart player Cosmic Cyclone's my Umi, I have a way to get my Sea Stealth Attack back online. It is worth noting that Hammer Shark + Warrior of Atlantis = exactly 4000 damage, which can be relevant sometimes.

***1x A Legendary Ocean***
Mainly in here to counter Cosmic Cyclone, but can be useful in some niche scenarios, for example to allow you to swarm with Hammer Shark + Abyss Soldier, or to make Citadel Whale a 1 tribute monster.

***3x Enemy Controller*** 
It's no secret that Enemy Controller is the best tech card in the game. If you look at the top 16 deck lists from MCS VI you will see that every single deck in the top cut was using 3 Enemy Controller in the main deck apart from 1 player, who was siding them. It is particularly potent in this deck, because you can use Hammer Shark to bring out Fishborg for the tribute, and then use Fishborg Planter to dig for a Citadel Whale. Anytime I opened with my combo and had an Enemy Controller for defense I felt like there was absolutely no way I could lose the game.

***2x Sea Stealth Attack*** 
This card has been heralded as the most powerful card in Duel Links, and for good reason. It gives you the ability to totally disregard any back row and has very few counter plays once you set up with Citadel Whale. 2 is optimal in this list because you can easily search it with Citadel Whale, and 3 can be bricky. Most people only main deck 1 Cosmic Cyclone, and they will usually target your Umi once they see you are playing Mythic Depths.

---

### Match Ups

**Alien**
Probably the most popular deck right now. Citadel Whale is incredibly strong here, being able to flat out negate roughly 8-10 core cards in the deck. Sea Stealth Attack is also very hard for them to deal with as they rely on the battle phase to deal with monsters, and Sea Stealth Attack is the king of the battle phase. You won't always be able to get Citadel Whale out on turn 1, and when you can't it is advisable to play slowly and defensively until you can make a big push. Abyss Soldier with Sea Stealth Attack can usually control the board long enough for you to get your Citadel Whale out. You should be winning this match up 80% of the time.

**Red-Eyes Zombie** 
This deck is heavily reliant on Enemy Controller and Storm, and both Citadel Whale and Sea Stealth Attack are fantastic counters to those cards. This match up is also highly in your favour, but it is not impossible to lose. If they open with {Gozuki}, {Red-Eyes Spirit} and Enemy Controller and you are unable to summon a Citadel Whale, you could be in trouble. When you do have Citadel Whale out, they rely heavily on forcing the banish with Storm, so try to get your second monster onto the field as quickly as possible to protect against this strategy. Abyss Soldier bouncing a {Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon} can be incredibly disruptive. 

*PRO TIP*: If you target {Samurai Skull} with Abyss Soldier it will trigger its effect to summon a zombie from the deck. DO NOT DO THIS!

**Gladiator Beast** 
This deck is still very viable contrary to popular belief. However, it has a terrible match up against Sea Stealth Attack because it relies heavily on back row and the battle phase to deal with monsters, and Sea Stealth Attack is able to effectively nullify defensive back row and attacks. Furthermore, Citadel Whale is nigh impossible for them to deal with because {Gladiator Beast Murmillo} targets. Their only option to deal with Sea Stealth Attack is to summon {Gladiator Beast Nerokius}, but this will be very hard for them to do with the offensive pressure you will be applying. Abyss Soldier is the MVP of this match up, destroying their momentum and allowing you to make sure they never get more than one monster on the field. It is also your only answer to Gladiator Beast Nerokius if it manages to hit the field.

**Mirror Match** 
This one is tricky to describe because there are so many variants. Level 5 spam and Grass builds do well here because they have the ability to constantly summon a high level water monster every turn, but the sheer consistency of the Shark Turbo and Gishki variants somewhat makes up for this. It often comes down to who can get their Citadel Whale on the field first, and who can keep summoning it back to the field after it gets destroyed by Sea Stealth Attack.

**Cyber Angels** 
Not as relevant as it used to be, but worth mentioning because it is by far your worst match up. They have the ability to OTK on turn 2 through Citadel Whale + Sea Stealth Attack, which no other deck can do. Also, their ritual spells can be used to protect against Sea Stealth Attack. Going second gives you a much better chance of winning vs CA, and the fact that we can put 2 monsters up in one turn slightly protects against {Cyber Angel Dakini}. If you can get multiple Sea Stealth Attack on board with Citadel Whale, your opponent will have to banish one ritual spell per copy of Sea Stealth Attack to protect their monster from destruction. Abyss Soldier can win the game on it's own if your opponent overextends into a first turn Saffira, Queen of Dragons or Cyber Angel Dakini play. Enemy Controller allows for quick OTK's and great protection against Cyber Angel Dakini. All in all it's a rough match but you should still win about 40% of the time.

**Burn/Stall/Mill** 
The omnipresent malignant cancer is actually not that hard to deal with. Abyss Soldier allows you to deal with problem card like {Temple of the Mind's Eye} and {Des Counterblow} and set up for an OTK, Citadel Whale gives you protection from {Massivemorph} and {Draining Shield} and Sea Stealth Attack lets you put 2 monsters up without worrying about {Lava Golem}. It's still really annoying but we have the tools at our disposal to win the stall match reasonably consistently.

---

### Conclusion

I think that Sea Stealth Attack is a fantastic card that everyone needs to be aware of. If you are not building your deck around it, you should be building your deck with it in mind, because if you don't have a strategy to deal with it you will lose every time. The deck is extremely versatile in the amount of engines that it can run which is fantastic because we're seeing a lot of creativity in terms of deck building and trying to figure out the best way to play this powerful card. I strongly feel that this is a Tier 1 deck, I'd love to know what you think in the comments down below.

If you got this far you are an absolute legend! Thanks for reading!
