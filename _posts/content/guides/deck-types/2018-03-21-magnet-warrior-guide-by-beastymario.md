### Introduction  

Magnet Warriors are arguably the most recognisable archetype due to their popularity in the anime. Though they may not be a top tier deck in the TCG/OCG, in Duel Links, it’s a different story. They are currently a 'Tier 3' deck which is defined as follows: 'They have potential - keep your eyes out for these deck-types. Don't expect to see them played often in a **competitive event** but do not ignore their existence when building your deck and choosing techs or it may be your downfall. A great player dedicated to one of these deck-types can dominate others through extensive experience.'  
So to summarize, don’t sleep on Magnets!  

Magnets is an archetype that focuses on milling your Rock monsters to the graveyard quickly with the use of {Delta The Magnet Warrior} and {Beta The Electromagnet Warrior} so that you can set up special summons and draw into your big plays. With the simple special summon requirements of {Gaia Plate the Earth Giant} and {Valkyrion the Magna Warrior}, in combination with {Anti-Magic Arrows}/{Storm}/{Hey, Trunade!}, this deck can easily OTK or disrupt/destroy your opponent.  

I believe this deck is very versatile and in this guide  I’ll explain and provide information on how and why this archetype can dominate the tier list.

### Decklists  

#### {Restart}  
Decklist by MiguelJoker  
Notable placings:  
- 1st place Shrimp King’s Tournament   
- 1st Place KC Cup Global 2018    
- 1st Place DLCS    
- 3rd place Duel Links Open #2    
- 6th Place Global KC Cup 2018  

[deck:Restart](Gaia Plate the Earth Giant; Gaia Plate the Earth Giant; Valkyrion the Magna Warrior; Delta The Magnet Warrior; Delta The Magnet Warrior; Delta The Magnet Warrior; Beta The Electromagnet Warrior; Beta The Magnet Warrior; Beta The Magnet Warrior; Beta The Magnet Warrior; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Storm; Storm; Powerful Rebirth; Powerful Rebirth; Powerful Rebirth; Wall of Disruption; Wall of Disruption)  

Restart is probably the best skill to use as it gives you a second opportunity to open with the combo of Delta/Electromagnet along with a {Powerful Rebirth}/{Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane}. This combo is key if you want to special summon your big monsters quickly. This deck has a pretty high chance to brick so Restart is the obvious choice for it to be as consistent as possible.

#### {Straight to the Grave}  
Decklist by MiguelJoker  
Notable placing:  
-   1st Place MCS Brazil  

[deck:Straight to the Grave](Gaia Plate the Earth Giant; Gaia Plate the Earth Giant; Valkyrion the Magna Warrior; Snipe Hunter; Delta The Magnet Warrior; Delta The Magnet Warrior; Delta The Magnet Warrior; Beta The Electromagnet Warrior; Beta The Magnet Warrior; Beta The Magnet Warrior; Beta The Magnet Warrior; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Storm; Storm; Powerful Rebirth; Powerful Rebirth; Powerful Rebirth; Curse of Anubis)  

Straight to the Grave (STTG) starts the duel with the Field Spell {Wasteland} active which boosts your Rock Type monster’s attack and defence by 200 points. With this, your monsters break the 1800 attack threshold that puts you above many popular monsters like {Gladiator Beast Laquari} and {Sergeant Electro}. Bare in mind that your Field Spell will also boost the attack of Dinosaur and Zombie type monsters, so with that said, you’re helping out REZ and Dinos even more. But the main benefit of this skill is that the Field Spell is fodder for your {Storm} plays. With the activation of Storm on two backrow cards and your Field Spell, you’re able to fully clear your opponent's backrow.

-   2nd Place [Meta Weekly 7](/tournaments/meta-weekly/7/report/)

[deck:Straight to the Grave](Gaia Plate the Earth Giant; Gaia Plate the Earth Giant; Gaia Plate the Earth Giant; Valkyrion the Magna Warrior; Delta The Magnet Warrior; Delta The Magnet Warrior; Delta The Magnet Warrior; Tackle Crusader; Block Golem; Block Golem; Beta The Electromagnet Warrior; Gamma The Magnet Warrior; Beta The Magnet Warrior; Beta The Magnet Warrior; Beta The Magnet Warrior; That Grass Looks Greener; That Grass Looks Greener; That Grass Looks Greener; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Enemy Controller; Storm; Storm; Skill Successor; Skill Successor; Triamid Pulse; Triamid Pulse; Triamid Pulse; Powerful Rebirth; Powerful Rebirth)  

The release of {That Grass Looks Greener} (Grass) has allowed a new variation of Magnet to flourish - 30 card Magnet mill decks. This style of deck can be played with a variety of skills like: {Duel, standby!}, Restart, {Balance}, or Straight to the Grave.  

But to quote Kaki on his decision of STTG over Restart: 'I played Restart at first but then you lose so hard to {Gladiator Beast Laquari} so you need the attack and that way you can win without Grass.' With {Triamid Pulse}, we are able to utilise the milled Rock monsters and banish them to destroy face-up monsters on the field as well as special summon Rock monsters from our graveyard. With the endless combos and synergy of this deck, it has won a Meta Weekly tournament and who knows what's in store in future.

### Core Cards  
Cards Necessary In Every Competitive Magnet Warrior Deck.  

### Monster Core

[deck](Gaia Plate the Earth Giant;Valkyrion the Magna Warrior;Delta the Magnet Warrior;Beta the Electromagnet Warrior;Beta the Magnet Warrior)  


- 2 x {Gaia Plate the Earth Giant} (Gaia):  
A powerful boss monster that is easy to special summon thanks to our graveyard fuel provided by our Magnet Warriors. Gaia is the key reason why this deck can keep up with [Hazy](/tier-list/hazy-flame/), [REZ](/tier-list/red-eyes-zombies/), and other big monsters thanks to Gaia’s effect that acts like an offensive {Mirror Wall}. Gaia is a great monster to fall back on late game in case the Valkyrion play becomes dead.  

- 1 x {Valkyrion the Magna Warrior} (Valkyrion):  
This big body monster is the main contributor in the capability to OTK your opponent. Without an answer, many of your opponents with surrender to the towering 3500 attack and 3850 defence of 'Val-freakin-Kyrion'. Since he can only be special summoned with Delta’s effect, the timing on doing so is important, so ensure you have the correct fuel in the graveyard to special summon him. Fortunately, Delta’s effect triggers when it’s sent to the graveyard from anywhere (hand/field or deck).  

- 3 x {Delta the Magnet Warrior} (Delta):  
The most important monster in the deck, Delta is what makes this deck work. It has two important effects that are key to winning.  
1.  It sends Electromagnet/Delta from your deck to the graveyard to allow a Rebirth/Kurogane play to mill your deck further.  
2.  Its effect when it’s sent to the graveyard to banish 3 Magnet Warriors (besides Delta) from your graveyard to special summon Valkyrion from your deck or hand is arguably the best combo, ever! 

- 1 x {Beta the Electromagnet Warrior} (Electromagnet):  
Beta the Electromagnet Warrior is like a combination of {Cyber Angel Idaten} and {Cyber Angel Benten} in one. With its two effects, it’s easily the second most important card in this deck. Its first effect lets you add a level 4 Magnet Warrior from your deck to your hand (you should usually choose Delta) when summoned or special summoned. Its second effect of tributing itself to special summon a level 4 Magnet Warrior (you should usually choose Delta) is what allows this deck to usually set up a Valkyrion play by turn 3 when going first.  

- 3 x {Beta the Magnet Warrior} (Beta):  
The main fodder for Delta’s effect. Beta is important to have in the graveyard so that we can special summon Valkyrion. He also serves as a 1700 attack beatstick that puts him above monsters like {Sergeant Electro}, {Gladiator Beast Bestiari}, {Gladiator Beast Dimacari}, and others. Its defence of 1600 is also nothing to laugh about since it stops many monsters that aren’t boosted by a Field Spell.  

### Spell Cards

[deck](Anti-Magic Arrows;Enemy Controller;Storm;Hey, Trunade!)

- 1-3 x {Anti-Magic Arrows} (AMA):  
Can be used in combination or replaced with {Storm} or {Hey, Trunade!}  
This card is what make this deck so explosive and so difficult to play around. The possibility of combos that can be done using AMA is why this deck can OTK or severely cripple an opponent.

- 3 x {Enemy Controller} (E.Con):  
Arguably the best card in Duel Links. Enemy Controller wins games and can be used offensively or defensively. This deck lacks defence so E.Con helps in that category, as well as providing an opportunity for an explosive play.

- 1-2 x {Storm}:  
Can be used in combination or replaced with Anti-Magic Arrows or Hey, Trunade!  
A good way to clear off an opponent's backrow. Powerful Rebirth can easily clog up the backrow so destroying it alongside your Field Spell or chaining an Econ can easily clear a full backrow and gain you the upper hand.

- 1-3 x {Hey, Trunade!}:  
Can be used in combination or replaced with Anti-Magic Arrows or Storm.  
A recent release in the [new minibox](/box-reviews/rampage-of-the-forest/), 'Hey, Trunade!' gave OTK decks a big boost. By returning all set spell and trap cards to the hand, you force your opponent to activate their set cards early or not at all and in doing so, there's no need to  worry about {Floodgate Trap Hole} or {Wall of Disruption} to stop your OTK.  

### Trap Cards

[deck](Powerful Rebirth;Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane)

- 2-3 x {Powerful Rebirth} (Rebirth):  
Can be used in combination or replaced with {Spiritual Earth Art- Kurogane}.  
This along with Kurogane, allows you to bring back your Electromagnet/Delta from the graveyard so that you can dump more Magnets into the graveyard quickly to set up your big plays with Valkyrion and Gaia. A good combo is to summon Delta, send Electromagnet to your graveyard and then Rebirth your Electromagnet. With your Electromagnet you can then use its effect to add a Delta to your hand, and then special summon your third Delta from your deck using Electromagnets second effect.

- 1-2 x {Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane}:  
Can be used in combination or replaced with Powerful Rebirth.  
A card we were recently able to attain 3 copies of. Kurogane works similar to Rebirth but a key difference is that this requires a tribute while Rebirth doesn’t. There are other unique combinations that can be used with this card which are explained more in the 'Tips/Advice/Combos' section.  

---

### What Skill is Best

Since the ideal opening hand is a Delta/Electromagnet with a Rebirth/Kurogane, the ratio of Rebirth to Kurogane in combination with a skill can completely change the consistency of the deck. Luckily for you, I’ve tested and calculated everything to help you choose what skill to use.

### Tech / Substitution Cards  
Cards That Can Replace/Substitute Without Hurting Functionality 
* Possible cards that can be replaced with these “Techs/Substitution” cards are: Enemy controller, AMA, Storm.

### Monsters

* 1 x {Snipe Hunter}:  
An interesting tech that can possibly destroy your opponents cards by sending unwanted Beta’s to the graveyard. Discarding a Delta using Snipe Hunters effect can also trigger its effect to summon Valkyrion, so keep that in mind.

* 1 x {Gladiator Beast Andal}:  
With a popular deck being Gladiator Beasts, adding the 1900 attack earth attribute Andal can be great in this deck as it synchronizes well with Kurogane. You also have the ability to special summon Andal from your deck by E.Con. taking an opponent's Gladiator Beast before the end of the battle phase.  

* 2-3 x {Block Golem}:  
A great way to bring back 4 star monsters from your graveyard like Beta the Electromagnet Warrior to use its effect the following turn. Keep in mind that Block Golem’s effect  makes that the monsters that were special summoned effects are negated this turn.  
**Note** Only viable in 30 card Grass deck.  

* 1 x {Tackle Crusader}:  
A nice tech in the 30 card grass deck as it can flip one of your opponent's monsters face down when sent to the graveyard (by battle or milling). Its second effect can also come in handy vs certain decks like Burn as you can return their {Burning Land} or {Temple of the Mind's Eye} back to their hand.  
**Note** Only viable in 30 card Grass deck.  

### Spells

* 1-3 x {Super Rush Headlong}:  
Currently a great card in this meta. SRH works well offensively and defensively. With the recent popularity of SSA and Hazy, their have the  ability to not be targeted by card effects, SRH changes that and can be used to kill off Hazy and Whale.  

* 1-2 x {Cosmic Cyclone}:  
With the recent rise of popularity in Sea Stealth Attack, Powerful Rebirth, and A Cell Recombination, using Cosmic Cyclone has become a staple in many decks. Cosmic Cyclone stops SSA and Rebirth in their tracks and can banish Recombination so that they can’t use its search effect later.  

* 3 x {That Grass Looks Greener}:  
The main factor in why the 30 card rock/magnet deck works. This card can easily mill 10+ cards at the start at the duel and doing so can provide fuel for your Triamid Pulse, Gaia Plate and Valkyrion.  
**Note** Only viable in 30 card Grass Deck.

### Traps

* 1 x {Curse of Anubis}:  
Probably the best mass protection card in the current meta. The good thing about Curse of Anubis is that it can be used offensively if attacking with a Beta/{Gamma the Magnet Warrior} as they are immune and can clear your opponents big monsters like Hazy, REZ, or {Ancient Gear Golem}.  

* 1-2 x {Divine Wrath}:  
A great card to run in this current meta. With so many effect monsters roaming around, Divine wrath helps destroy them and it synergizes very well with Magnets because it can help discard any Betas that have made its way onto your hand.  

* 1-2 x {Wall of Disruption}:  
Wall of D can stop your opponent's monsters dead in their tracks. With decks that swarm the field quickly, and with the recent popularity of Saffira CA,  Wall of D can easily set your opponent's monsters attack to "0" and stop them dead on their tracks...  

* 1-2 x {Mirror Wall}:  
With the recent release of Hey! Trunade, cards that aren’t activatable before the battle step are becoming less popular. Mirror Wall can be chained to Trunade, therefore preventing it from being returned to the hand. It can stop your opponent dead in their tracks and help buy you another turn by paying the cost to keep it on the field. It also is arguably one of the best defensive cards in the game.  

* 3 x {Triamid Pulse}:  
The second most important card in the 30 card grass deck. It is used on your milled monsters to activate one of two great effects that this card has. You can banish two monsters to 
    * Destroy an opponent's face-up monster
    * Special summon a rock monster from your graveyard  in face up defense.
**Note** Only viable in 30 card Grass Deck.

* 0-2 x {Release from Stone}:  
A nice card to special summon any one of your banished monsters. Works great if you banish any of your Gaia’s with the effect of Triamid Pulse as you can special summon him back onto the field with this card. Keep in mind that you can’t use Release from Stone on Valkyrion.  
**Note** Only viable in 30 card Grass Deck.

* 0-2 x {Ghosts from the Past}:  
Although this doesn’t see much use, it is another way to use the milled monsters in your graveyard to banish them and lower your opponent's attack to 0 in the damage step.  
**Note** Only viable in 30 card Grass Deck.

* 1-3 x {Skill Successor}:  
One of the first graveyard trap cards added to the game,Skill Successor works very well in decks that mill themselves. This card can be used in the back row to give you a 400 attack boost in the damage step and while in the graveyard, it can add 800 attack points to your monster in the Damage Step. Just keep in mind that it can be activated the turn it’s sent to the graveyard. The 800 attack boost is substantial as it can boost your Beta to 2500 attack (without STTG), which is above the 2400 threshold in which REZ is at. The 2500 attack also gives you the opportunity to suicide with opposing {Saffira, Queen of Dragons}.  
**Note** Only viable in 30 card Grass Deck.

---

### Side Deck  

Although side deck cards can vary depending on the current meta, it is always good to prepare for the most popular and your decks weakness. But overall, these following cards can mostly be used in a combination or multiples of 5 to counter this current meta.  

[deck](4-Starred Ladybug of Doom;Cosmic Cyclone;Storm;Eternal Drought;Foolish Return;Wall of Disruption;Wild Tornado)  

---

### Matchup Guide  

This covers the matchups for the main decktypes you will face. I will go over a short description of each decktype matchup, the win condition and the estimated win rate. This will be updated as new decktypes emerge in the meta.

---

### Red-Eyes Zombies  

Probably one of the more difficult matchups, R.E.Z. has the ability to swarm the field with ease and along with protection like Enemy Controller and Super Rush Headlong. This magnet deck lacks protection so we are vulnerable to the favorite E.Con. take plays that R.E.Z. love to do and our big monsters don’t stand a chance to SRH. A majority of the magnet deck wins come from the O.T.K. with our boss monsters after an AMA or Storm activation. But even with that, REZ has one card that prevents that, {Bacon Saver}. Another reason that makes their deck so unpredictable is that you don’t know if they’re playing the AMA, the Storm or the Hey, Trunade! version. So it becomes a mind game of whether or not to set the little protection we have and risk it getting stormed or returned to the hand or pre-activate a card to anticipate the possible AMA.  

- WIN CONDITION  

The ways to beat REZ is by forcing them to use their Bacon Saver early and Storming away their back row so they’re forced to use it early or using AMA so that our boss monsters can clean up and win fast. The longer the duel goes on, the game becomes more into our favor since we have Gaia late game. Keep in mind that the only way they can get over a Valkyrion or Gaia is by using Enemy Controller, Super Rush Headlong or us attacking into a {Wall of Disruption}/{Mirror Wall}. Like any deck vs REZ, if you survive their Storm play, you are more likely to win.  

* Win Rate: **40%**  

---

### Gladiator Beasts  

Somewhat of a favorable matchup, Gladiator Beasts are really dependent on their back row. Gladiator Decks typically run 3 {Floodgate Trap Hole} along with many trap cards that can’t be activated until attack declaration. Both which play in our favor. Once we summon our first Magnet Warrior and they see the deck we are playing, players typically try to save their Floodgates for our big monsters. That makes our AMA and Storm that much more valuable. Against Gladiators, you want to try and set up a Valkyrion + AMA play as quick as possible.  

- WIN CONDITION  

A high percentage of Gladiators run the skill {Balance} meaning that they open 1 monster (that they usually set) along with 3 backrow. So if you open with an AMA, it wouldn’t be a bad decision to use it early to destroy their only monster and forcing them to a top deck situation in which they have to draw a monster.  

* Win Rate: **60%**  

---

### Aliens  

What may appear like an intimidating match-up, the Alien matchup is slightly even. Aliens focus on putting A-Counters on your monsters so that in return they can use those counters to destroy your back row, special summon, or lower your attack drastically. With {Alien Telepath} being the same attack as Delta, that sets up the perfect suicide Delta play to special summon Valkyrion. Besides that, we have 2 cards that help us versus the Alien matchup and I will explain what they are and how to use them below. Also, when attacking Alien monsters, please keep track and calculate the attack reduction of your monsters when they have counters on them. A simple way to calculate your damage reduction is: **# of A-Counters on the field x 300 x total # of face up Aliens**.  

- WIN CONDITION  

Beta the Electromagnet Warrior is what I would consider our “bait” for those A-Counters. You want to attack their facedown monsters using Beta the Electromagnet and bait out the counters because you can easily use its effect on your opponent’s turn to tribute it, taking all those counters with it. You really want to save your Wall of Disruption until they have at least 2 monsters on the field so that you can potentially set up your OTK. So playing passively is recommended. Set a normal Beta alongside a Wall of Disruption so that your opponent gets stopped in their tracks, then on the following turn you can Storm or Trunade the rest of their backrow and go for the OTK by E.Con taking or special summoning Gaia.  

* Win Rate: **50%**  

---

### Cyber Angels / Saffira  

Another favorable matchup. CAffira biggest weakness is that they lack backrow and they’re vulnerable to Enemy Controllers take play. Keep in mind that their only protection for there monsters come from {Hymn of Light} and {Machine Angel Ritual} in their graveyard. Keep track of those cards before going for the big play.  

- WIN CONDITION  

Being one of the few decks that standardly run 3 Enemy Controllers, this matchup is slightly in our favor. If an E.Con take play is open for the chance to win, take it. One more thing to add is that they have difficulty getting over a Gaia. They would need to have a 5600 Attack monster to at least crash with Gaia and with no fear of backrow, Gaia can slowly wear them down.  

* Win Rate: **70%**  

---

### Sea Stealth Attack  

A deck that requires a 3 card combo to be at its strongest, and once they do so, they are almost impossible to stop. There’s two main versions of the deck, one which runs a plethora of 5 star water monsters to spam and beat you down fast with them. The second version, the more powerful and successful one (aka Whale Turbo), runs {Hammer Shark} and Fishborg Planter} to get {Citadel Whale} out as fast as possible. The 3 card combo they both need to get going is a {Sea Stealth Attack}, {Umi}/{A Legendary Ocean}, and a 5+ Star water monster. Citadel Whale is definitely the last monster you want to see on the field. It negates any card effects that target any water monsters so your E.Con take play is basically dead. Remember that Gaia’s effect doesn’t work on {The Legendary Fisherman II}, so remember to take that into consideration when calculating your attacks.  

- WIN CONDITION  

The key to beating both versions is to get rid of their field spell quickly before they can get to monsters on the field alongside a SSA. If that fails, your only fall back is AMA or {Cosmic Cyclone} (if you’re one of the few that main deck it). If you aren’t main decking an Anti-Magic Arrow or Cosmic Cyclone in your main deck when they have a Whale with another monster and SSA on the field, you might as well surrender. Since our deck doesn’t main deck a Super Rush Headlong, we are forced to rely on AMA or Cosmic Cyclone to get over their Whale. AMA negates all the effects of SSA (even if it’s face up already) so you’re free to attack into their whale without fear of the destroying effect of SSA. If you get the chance to Cosmic Cyclone or Storm, make sure to go for the field spell to render their SSA useless. Getting over their monsters isn’t an issue since we have Gaia and Valkyrion to easily get over them.  

* Win Rate (with AMA): **60%**  
* Win Rate (with Storm): **30%**  

---

### Dinos  

Arguably our worst match up, the swarming capability of Dinos is what makes their deck so difficult for us to play against. {Hydrogeddon} is the kryptonite to our deck with not having much protection. Hydrogeddon can easily attack over our monsters and swarm the field and severely hurt our life points before we have an opportunity to set up a play. By the time we can set up a play, they have backrow to prevent such a play.  

- WIN CONDITION  

A godly starting hand or a brick on their part would help us out to set up our Valkyrion play early. In today's meta, Dino’s hate backrow so they’re notorious for running {Xing Zhen Hu}, Cosmic Cyclone, and {Fire Formation - Gyokkou. With that said, you have to be careful when setting your back row. If you set your backrow and your turn successfully ends, turn your toggle to **“ON”** and use your Rebirth or Kurogane in their draw phase to prevent your card from being pinned or destroyed. Another thing to take note is that the only real protection Dino’s run is Wall of Disruption. So attacking with your Gaia while having no more than two monsters is usually safe. You can also hold onto your Enemy Controllers in your hand as you can maybe E.Con take in the battle step as wall of disruption resolves in attack declaration. Be sure to have your toggle set to **“ON”**.  

* Win Rate: **30%**  

---

### Hazy  

A  favorable matchup. But first keep in mind that our Enemy Controllers are basically useless so try not to set them until the Storm play. The current most popular {Hazy Flame Sphynx} deck is the {Aroma Strategy} version, which is usually the slowest version of Hazy in terms of swarming the field and getting a big Hazy out with {Beast Rising}. The Aroma Strategy relies a lot on the use of Soul Exchange so this is where Electromagnet and Kurogane work best. If Electromagnet is targeted by soul exchange, activate its effect to special summon a Magnet Warrior from your deck, doing so makes the used Soul Exchange dead. Kurogane can be used in the same way.  

- WIN CONDITION  

The best and easiest way to beat Aroma Hazy (if they haven’t activated Beast Rising) is to set up a suicide Delta into Valkyrion play after using Arrows. If they have a big Hazy out already, beating them down with Gaia is amazing since a Hazy would have to be more than 5600 attack for our Gaia to not destroy it. Keep in mind that Aroma Hazy runs Floodgate so be careful when summoning Gaia. If it comes to worst and they have a +5600 attack Hazy, the only way in defeating them is attacking with Beta and chaining {Curse of Anubis} in the battle step.  
Beatdown Hazy is basically an instant win once we get out our Gaia or Valk since they can’t get over a 3000 attack monster.  

* Win Rate: **70%**  

---

### Ancient Gears  

Ancient Gears is a control style deck that relies on protecting {Sergeant Electro} and stalling until {Ancient Gear Golem} can be summoned. With the combination of AMA and Storm, we can severely cripple their field and set up an easy OTK. Ancient Gears love to play Floodgate, Enemy Controller, and Super Rush Headlong so be cautious and efficient on when you decide to set up your play.  

- WIN CONDITION  

Delta and Sergeant Electro have the same attack in 1600, making that an amazing  suicide AMA play (with Valkyrion fuel in the graveyard). It’s difficult to bounce back once they take 3500 damage to the face. Just be weary of the popular {Sphere Kuriboh} they love to use in their decks.

* Win Rate: **70%**  

---

### Endless Trap Stall / Burn  

A difficult match-up for basically everyone. Both of their decks rely heavily on their trap card backrow. The {Endless Trap Hell} Stall plays defensive monsters like {Man-Eater Bug} and {D.D. Warrior}. D.D. Warrior counters Magnets completely as it banishes our monsters instead of sending them to the graveyard. Doing so, it by-passes Delta’s effect to summon Valkyrion. Versus the standard Weevil/{Destiny Draw} Burn, your key objective is slowly wearing down their life points with AMA and waiting for the Storm play to clear their back row.  

- WIN CONDITION  

The thing is, summoning Valkyrion isn’t our win condition versus the Endless Trap deck. Every monster in our deck is going to needed because of their destroying/banishing monster effects. So try not to activate Delta’s effect. Slowly wear down your opponents monsters and wait until you have an opportunity to go for the OTK with a Storm or AMA play. Versus the easier matchup of  Weevil/Destiny Draw burn, waiting for a OTK Storm/AMA play is the key to winning. Be careful when you calculate the damage because they run the {Temple of the Mind's Eye} field spell.  

* Win Rate vs Endless: **30%**  
* Win Rate vs Burn: **70%**  

---

### Mirror Match  

A matchup that favors the first turn player as it’s a battle to the races on who can bring out their big monsters faster. Each player knows the explosiveness of the e. con. take play so expect a duel vs the mirror match to be fast.

- WIN CONDITION  

Just like any other duel, opening with your main combo is key and obviously going first heavily favors that player. One key play that can change the outcome of the game is to e.con take your opponents electromagnet warrior during their turn and activating its second effect. Your opponent won’t be able to counter the e.con take play using electromagnets effect because it is still their turn. From there, summon your big monsters as fast as you can.  

* Win Rate vs Magnets (going first): **70%**  
* Win Rate vs Magnets (going second): **30%**

### Tips / Advice / Combos  

If playing the more common {Restart} version, you may be wondering what kind of opening hand should you aim for. The opening hand is crucial with this deck and the success of this deck relies heavily on it. To put it in simple terms, if you don’t open a Delta or Beta the Electromagnet Warrior, **RESTART**. Ideally the best hand would be Delta along with a Powerful Rebirth or Kurogane. Below is an example of a risky hand to restart. Ideally it’s not a hand you’d like to open with but luckily the risk of restarting paid off.

When you open with a Delta and you summon it, **ALWAYS** activate its effect and always send Electromagnet to the graveyard. Rebirth/Kurogane to the Electromagnet gives you +1 to your hand and can give you the possibility to mill 4 cards from your deck by adding a Delta from your deck to your hand when he is summoned/special summoned to the field, and then special summoning a Delta from your deck. 

When you special/summon Electromagnet, activate his first effect to add a Delta to your hand. Always keep track of how many Deltas there are left in your deck as you don’t want to accidentally be forced to add a Beta to your hand. You want Betas in the graveyard, not your hand. 

Electromagnet’s effect works amazing as it can prevent cards that target it. For example: if your opponent {Soul Exchange}s, E.Con. takes, or uses {Gladiator Beast Murmillo}’s effect, you can active Electromagnets effect to special summon a Magnet Warrior from your deck, therefore negating the targeting effect. It’s always best to activate Electromagnet’s second effect in your opponent's end phase, that way you can save its effect in case your opponent tries to target it with anything during their turn. Here is an example of what I’m talking about. So when playing against GB, it’s a good idea to bait out a murmillo if Electromagnet is the only monster on your board. Like the example shown below.

If special summoning Gaia before Valkyrion, always try to banish Delta’s from the graveyard instead of Electromagnet or Betas. This deck needs 3 out of 4 cards to be banished in order to  special summon Valkyrion (1 Electromagnet and 3 Betas) so banishing one of those makes it more difficult to special summon Valkyrion later in game. Also keep in mind that Gaia needs to banish 1 rock monster in your standby phase in order to stay on the board. So if you click “yes” you’re forced to banish potential Valkyrion fuel if not cautious.

Kurogane is an interesting card that we just got two of recently. Kurogane requires the tribute of an earth monster to special summon a 4 star earth monster from our graveyard. Kurogane can be used to prevent your monsters from being Soul Exchanged, E.Con. tributed taken, getting rid of a flood gated monster, and lastly it has one more interesting combo that can be used with it. Since Kurogane requires the tribute of an earth monsters, you can E.Con. tribute take an opponent's {Gladiator Beast Dimacari} or {Gozuki} and use Kurogane on it since they both are earth monsters.

The special summon capability of Valkyrion after an AMA activation and the ability to OTK is arguably the best combo in Duel Links. This combo can be done in a few different ways:  

* Suicide Delta into an opponent’s monster, then doing so will activate Delta’s effect and you can special summon Valkyrion with the protection of AMA.  

* At the start of your battle phase, activate Enemy Controller and tribute Delta to take an opponent's monster and then chaining AMA to that. If you e. con. took your opponent’s only monsters, it’s basically “GG”.

### Conclusion  

I truly believe Gaia/Magnets deserves its place on the tier list. With its capability to OTK and severely cripple the field with plays using AMA/Storm, it’s very difficult to play around. This deck has no issues keeping up with the top tier decks. It can also be argued that it can handle some top tier decks better than its twin deck, REZ.  

“Magnets are a worse Red-Eyes Zombie deck” says Dkayed. Well in reality, they both do each thing differently. While REZ has more ways to search and send cards to the graveyard, Magnets can thin their deck out just as quick, if not, quicker and therefore allowing them to draw into their big plays as well. I believe Magnets has more answers to the top tier decks in this current meta than REZ does. While REZ usually sits and waits for for their big Storm play, Magnets with the combination of Gaia and Valk can run through big monsters.  

Furthermore, Magnets are on the rise (pun intended). As they are increasing in popularity, more and more players are reaching King of Games with different variations. In the tournament setting, many have been placing very well and a some have even won. As more rock/magnet support cards are being released, it may be only a matter of time before it becomes a higher tier deck.
