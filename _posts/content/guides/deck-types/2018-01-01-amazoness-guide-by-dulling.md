### Introduction
 
An archetype that has been in Duel Links since the very beginning, Amazoness has only become competitively viable recently due to some new cards released. What was once clunky, and seemingly lacked a win condition, has now become very consistent, and has a very clear win condition. This deck deserves to be on the tier list, and should be expected in any large-scale tournament.


#### About the Author
 
Hello there, my name is Dulling, and I decided to write a guide on Amazoness. Some of you may know me from General Chat in the Discord, and even fewer may recognise me from my Alien guide. Despite being commonly labeled as a troll, I do try and help out players in any way I can, and am very active in the Amazoness channel. I’m very good at theoretical gameplay, which really helps me analyse matchups and figure out appropriate deck ratios. While this deck isn’t as difficult to master as some of the other decks in the current meta, it still has some hidden pathways, and I hope to be able to share those with you through this guide. Without further ado, here is (part one of) my Amazoness guide.

### Skill Overview 

Going to cut straight to the chase with this one; {Restart} is the optimal skill for this deck. It allows you to return bad hands to the deck, in order to try and draw a more playable hand. As this deck relies around Onslaught (see Deck Core) as its primary win condition, It is necessary that you have it on your first turn, as it is very difficult to win without it. These other skills may be used, but aren’t recommended by any means, as most of them are unnecessary or are outshined by other skills.   

* {Balance}:  
Assures a predictable monster-spell-trap ratio with every starting hand, but does not guarantee access to Onslaught, and makes it so that you open with it far less consistently than with Restart.  

* {The Ties That Bind}:  
Boosts your monsters’ ATK until the end phase, somewhat redundant in a deck that wins by banishing your opponent’s monsters, and does not add any consistency to the deck.  

* {Firm as EARTH}:  
Same reasoning as above, but will give a larger ATK boost, making it arguably better than The Ties That Bind, but still not as good as Restart.  

*TL;DR: Restart is best, screw the rest*

### Decklist Breakdown  
This section will help you construct your deck. Not really much else to put here, have fun reading.

#### Deck Core
[deck](Amazoness Princess;Amazoness Queen;Amazoness Swords Woman;Amazoness Baby Tiger;Amazoness Onslaught)

* **{Amazoness Princess}**   
* **Utility: Consistency**
* **Count: Always 3**
This archetype’s do-all card, Princess can search your deck for any “Amazoness” S/T card on summon, as well as Special Summon any Amazoness monster from your deck by sending a card from your hand or field to the graveyard. This card is the best opening monster, and nearly every hand that sees her is good. Do note that Princess can become a liability to have on the field after Queen is out, and can lead to an accidental suicide, as it cannot be killed. ALWAYS check your opponent’s board state before summoning Queen.

* **{Amazoness Queen}**   
* **Utility: Boss Monster, Prevents Destruction**  
* **Count: Always 1**
Queen serves as our boss monster, and will prevent your Amazoness monsters from being destroyed by battle, including herself. She is often the optimal search for Princess, and will often cause your opponent to lose the game if they have no means of removing her from the field. Getting the card will take time, as the only obtainable copy is obtained by leveling Mai up to 45. I would not recommend this deck in tournament play without Queen, as it adds much-needed power to win many games.

* **{Amazoness Swords Woman}**   
* **Utility: Prevents Battle Damage**  
* **Count: Recommend 3**
Swordswoman is the deck’s “free attacker”. Your opponent takes all battle damage from battles involving her instead, giving an alternate win condition against larger monsters, and becoming light protection against Wall of Disruption. It has amazing synergy with Queen, allowing her to constantly attack with next-to-no repercussions, as she cannot be destroyed by battle while Queen is on the field.  

* **{Amazoness Baby Tiger}**  
* **Utility: Field Swarm**  
* **Count: Recommend 2**
Baby Tiger can summon herself from the hand or graveyard when another Amazoness monster enters the battlefield. This makes it a free summon even after it has been destroyed, providing a very strong wall when paired with Onslaught. It is also a perfect tribute for E-Con, as well as amazing Princess fodder. Despite how good it is, its effect can only be used once per turn, and opening numerous copies can often be problematic, as anything past the first copy loses all of its value.

* **{Amazoness Onslaught}**   
* **Utility: Field Swarm, Monster Removal**  
* **Count: Always 3**  
Onslaught is one of the most powerful cards in the game, allowing you to banish any monster that battles with an Amazoness monster you control. It can also Special Summon an Amazoness monster from your hand during the Battle Phase, as well as give the Special Summoned monster 500 additional ATK until the end of the turn. This effect can be used by every face-up Onslaught you control. This card is the center of this deck, and will often lose if it is not used early in the game, or if it is removed by the opponent, and you are unable to get another out.

*TL;DR: Don’t got 3 Princess and don’t want to get Queen? Don’t play this deck. End of Story.*

#### Deck Remainder  
[deck](Amazoness Paladin;Amazoness Sage;Amazoness Scouts;Enemy Controller;Forbidden Chalice;Cosmic Cyclone;Offerings to the Doomed;Amazoness Willpower;Powerful Rebirth)

* **{Amazoness Paladin}**   
* **Utility: Beatstick**  
* **Count: Recommend 1 (shared with Sage and Scouts)**  
Paladin is the archetype’s highest-ATK low-level monster. She gains 100 ATK for every Amazoness monster on your side of the field. Aside from that, she has no added effects, and is usually just filler. She does help get over certain monsters that other low-levels wouldn’t be able to, such as any low-level HERO monster, Geargianchor, Geargiattacker, low-level Alien monsters, and Archfiend Cavalry. Do note that some of the cards listed above can only be destroyed by having more than just Paladin out.

* **{Amazoness Sage}**  
* **Utility: Spell/Trap Destruction**  
* **Count: Recommend 1 (shared with Sage and Scouts)**  
Sage is able to destroy a S/T on your opponent’s side of the field after she has successfully remained on the field after she attacked. While good on its own, the effect can be prevented simply by preventing the attack. Granted, this still removes a backrow card from your opponent’s side of the field, but it may not have been the card you were directly targeting. Sage’s effect is also most useful against decks that are already favourable for Amazoness, and will often end up being useless in the less favourable matchups.

* **{Amazoness Scouts}**  
* **Utility: Prevents Destruction**  
* **Count: Recommend 1 (shared with Sage and Scouts)**  
Scouts can sacrifice itself to prevent your monsters from being targeted by monster effects, and from being destroyed by card effects for the turn. It is extremely useful against decks that will constantly destroy your field, such as Sylvans and Geargias, but can be useless in matches that rely on attacking to remove monsters. If its effect is useless in any given matchup, then the card can still be used as a shield and/or Princess fodder, but won’t be as useful as any of the other 2 cards in those types of matches.  

* **{Enemy Controller}**  
* **Utility: Negating Attacks**  
* **Count: Recommend 3**  
E-Con is one of the most useful and versatile backrow cards we currently have, and is the deck’s alternate way of getting over monsters it can’t handle. It can change the battle position of one face-up monster your opponent controls, or tribute one of your own to steal an opponent’s monster for a turn. The steal effect has great synergy with Princess, allowing you to steal their monster, and to use it as fodder to summon another monster with Princess.

* **{Forbidden Chalice}**  
* **Utility: Negating Effects, Minor Attack Boost**  
* **Count: Recommend 2-3 (shared with Cyclone and Offerings)**  
Chalice can negate the effect of any face-up monster on the field, as well as boost the ATK of the selected monster. It is mostly used for the effect negation, but the ATK boost can occasionally be used to steal games. It is very useful in more disadvantageous matchups, allowing you to negate your opponent’s problematic monsters’ effects, such as Komushroomo and Geargianchor.

* **{Cosmic Cyclone}**  
* **Utility: Spell/Trap Removal**  
* **Count: Recommend 2-3 (shared with Cyclone and Offerings)**  
Cyclone can banish any S/T on the field for a cost of 1000 LP. It is mostly useful against decks that rely on one specific backrow card to win, and can even steal games against decks that run light backrow, allowing you to banish their only protection card. It is especially useful in the mirror match and against Archfiends.

* **{Offerings to the Doomed}**  
* **Utility: Monster Destruction**  
* **Count: Recommend 2-3 (shared with Cyclone and Offerings)**  
Offerings can destroy target face-up monster on the field, with the cost of skipping your next draw phase, making it an alternate monster destruction card. While seemingly contradictory to what Onslaught already accomplishes, this is useful to remove monsters that Onslaught cannot, such as anything summoned by Rose Lover or Chaos Hunter. It can also help to steal games, as you open up more direct attacks against your opponent. Do note that this card is being used in place of Headlong. If you do not own the desired amount, then Headlong is the more affordable alternative.

* **{Amazoness Willpower}**  
* **Utility: Monster Recovery**  
* **Count: Recommend 2 (shared with Rebirth)**  
Willpower will allow you to Special Summon any Amazoness monster from your graveyard back to the battlefield in attack position . Its position cannot be changed, and must attack each turn, if able. If your opponent changes its position, then it will be locked in defense position. It is preferred by some because it can bring back a destroyed Queen from the graveyard, forcing your opponent to destroy it once again. Some dislike it because the monster is fragile, and will be destroyed if this card is removed from the field.

* **{Powerful Rebirth}**  
* **Utility: Monster Recovery**  
* **Count: Recommend 2 (shared with Rebirth)**  
Scouts can sacrifice itself to prevent your monsters from being targeted by monster effects, and from being destroyed by card effects for the turn. It is extremely useful against decks that will constantly destroy your field, such as Sylvans and Geargias, but can be useless in matches that rely on attacking to remove monsters. If its effect is useless in any given matchup, then the card can still be used as a shield and/or Princess fodder, but won’t be as useful as any of the other 2 cards in those types of matches.

*TL;DR: Run 10 monsters, Always use protection, and Win-more cards actually win more games*


#### Card Count Explanation
This section will quickly explain why I recommend using the above cards in the counts that I did.

* 3 Princess, 1 Queen, 3 Onslaught: The absolute necessities in this deck, any fewer of these will greatly hurt the deck in general.  

* 3 Swordswoman: Great against decks that will use one boss monster over and over again, which is the majority of the meta. Also gives free attacks with Queen, which is much-needed in this type of deck.  

* 2 Baby Tiger: Really great wall, but opening more than 1 is often detrimental to the deck, as it becomes dead after the first copy. 2 reduces the chance to open, but it can always be searched with Princess anyways.  

* 1 Sage/Scouts/Paladin: Honestly just a filler slot, I recommend staying as close to the 10-10 ratio as possible. The chosen card will usually boil down to personal preference. I recommend using Scouts only if it will be useful against a significant portion of the meta.  

* 3 E-Con: Still one of the best and most versatile backrow cards we have to date, with the added bonus of pairing extremely well with Princess and Baby Tiger.  

* 2 Rebirth/Willpower: Monster recovery is still a must in this deck, even if Queen is being used, as most meta decks will have a way to remove your own monsters from the field. Running too many will lead to backrow clog, and a lack of much-needed defensive options.  

* 2-3 Chalice/Cyclone/Offerings: Additional protection/disruption cards, selection will often be based on the meta. For example, if Amazoness is the most popular deck in the meta, Cyclone will help counter that deck more than the other cards would. The 21-card total is in case you disagree with running the recommended amount, and wish to run less, as one of these 3 cards will often be what you plan on including in your list instead.  


#### Final Tips
These are just a few questions that you should ask yourself while finalising your list. I recommend editing your deck according to these questions.

* Will you get flooded with too many monsters/too many S/T cards in the average hand? Staying as close to 10-10 as possible is recommended. Anything more than an 11-9 ratio is prone to bricks.  

* Will you lose to direct attacks? If you are relying too heavily on exclusively using Onslaught to win games, you can often lose to your opponent just attacking into your monsters for lethal.  

* Will your backrow be redundant? Too much protection can cause most of it to be dead weight, especially when paired with Onslaught, which needs a battle to happen to even use the card.  

* Does it have any way to deal with unfavourable matchups? There are certain archetypes, such as Geargias, which are near-impossible to beat without any form of countermeasure. Running at least one counter card can help a lot, and can avoid complete auto-losses to these types of decks.

### Tech and Side Cards
[deck](Vision HERO Witch Raider;Lava Golem;Super Rush Headlong;Wall of Disruption;Massivemorph;Divine Wrath;Treacherous Trap Hole;Spirit Barrier)
This section will be focusing on cards that shouldn’t always be prioritised when deckbuilding, but work well with the deck in certain matchups. As such, these types of cards will often be found in sidedecks during tournaments, and occasionally as niche 1-ofs in maindecks. This section will solely be addressing cards that counter numerous decks, or that have natural synergy with the deck, and will not include cards that are used solely to counter one specific matchup.

* **{Vision HERO Witch Raider}**  
* **Utility: Spell/Trap Destruction, Alternate Boss Monster**  
* **For: Amazoness, Aliens**  
Witch Raider can be Tribute Summoned by tributing monsters as well as traps, giving it great synergy with Rebirth and Willpower. When summoned, it can destroy all of your opponent’s S/T cards. Do note that if you activate this effect, you will not be able to Special Summon any Amazoness monster for the rest of that turn. It is useful mostly against decks that rely heavily on backrow, such as Amazoness. While not unusable against other decks, it cannot be summoned by Onslaught, and can become a dead card because of this
**Note:** Synergizes with Rebirth and Willpower

* **{Lava Golem}**  
* **Utility: Monster Destruction, LP Reduction**  
* **For: Geargia**  
Golem can be Special Summoned to the opponent’s side of the field by tributing any 2 of their monsters. It will deal 1000 damage to them during each of their standby phases, and will prevent you from Normal Summoning the turn it is summoned. It has natural synergy with Swordswoman, allowing you to deal extra damage with no major risk, and can often steal games by itself. It is useful against Geargias, who will establish themselves by losing a lot of LP, making Lava Golem a way to hit lethal while removing their board presence.
**Note:** Synergizes with Amazoness Swords Woman

* **{Super Rush Headlong}**  
* **Utility: Monster Destruction**  
* **For: Amazoness, Aliens**  
Headlong, similarly to Onslaught, can remove your opponent’s monsters from the field by battling. It will destroy them instead of banishing, and triggers before battle damage is dealt. It is useful to prevent your opponent from stealing games by attacking one of your indestructible monsters due to Queen, and can help reduce overall damage taken during battle. It has fallen out of favour, simple because of Offerings doing the same thing, but more effectively. Anything that refers to Offerings will likely refer to this card as well.

* **{Wall of Disruption}**  
* **Utility: Attack Reduction**  
* **For: Aliens**  
WoD has fallen out of favour to many due to how popular Sylvans have become, which will be immune to traps the turn they summon a boss monster using Rose Lover. It reduces the ATK of all attack-position monsters your opponent controls when they declare an attack. It is most useful against Aliens, and will often be a usable card with any hand. Due to its decreased popularity, it provides more of a surprise factor against certain decks, but should not be used over other spells against Sylvans, as they will often be immune to traps.
**Note:** Overall a good card

* **{Massivemorph}**  
* **Utility: Attack Prevention**  
* **For: Masked Heroes**  
Massivemorph will double the ATK and DEF of target face-up monster your opponent controls, as well as preventing it from attacking you directly. It is useful against Masked Hero Anki, who can steal games by attacking directly through your own monsters. Do note that if you have an attack position monster aside from Swordswoman, they will be able to hit you for lethal, except if it is a Queen, which will deal 3200. It synergises well with Swordswoman, allowing you to deal even more damage against their large monsters that you couldn’t have attacked over anyways.
**Note:** Synergizes with Amazoness Swords Woman

* **{Divine Wrath}**  
* **Utility: Negating Effects**  
* **For: Sylvans, Geargias, Archfiends, Spellbooks**  
Wrath can negate the activation and effect of any monster’s effect on the field, with a cost of discarding one card from your hand. It is useful against many different decks, and most useful against less favourable matchups, such as Sylvans and Geargias, who rely only on monster effects to win the game. However, as this deck will often find itself pumping resources to the field, it will often run out of cards in hand, rendering this card useless in these sorts of situations.

* **{Treacherous Trap Hole}**  
* **Utility: Monster Destruction**  
* **For: Spellbooks, Geargias**  
TTH will destroy any 2 target creatures on the field. It must select 2 monsters, and cannot be activated if there is only 1, or if you have any other trap cards in the graveyard. Even though this deck runs other traps, they are continuous, and, on paper, won’t ever hit the graveyard. It deals with decks that need monsters on the field to work, such as Geargias and Spellbooks, but will cost you one of your own monsters if they only control one, making Offerings better in that scenario. However, TTH is better in the late-game, as it can deal with established fields more effectively.

* **{Spirit Barrier}**  
* **Utility: Preventing Damage**  
* **For: Masked Heroes**  
Barrier will prevent all battle damage dealt to you as long as you control a creature. It can be used effectively in this deck, as your monsters cannot be destroyed by battle with Queen, and your opponent can no longer deal damage, unless they manage to remove all of your monsters from the field. It is most useful against Masked Heroes, as it prevents Anki from dealing damage when attacking directly with his effect, removing their main win condition almost entirely.
**Note:** Overall good against most archetypes

### Conclusion
This concludes the first part of this guide, and should help you build your Amazoness deck. The next half, which I plan on completing by the end of the May (could be longer, not sure how busy I’ll be yet), will discuss matchups in more detail, as well as include a legitimate conclusion, and a “Special Thanks” section, because that's what decent human beings are apparently supposed to do. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed my guide, and hopefully it wasn’t complete trash like I expected it to be. 

Until next time,

~Dulling
