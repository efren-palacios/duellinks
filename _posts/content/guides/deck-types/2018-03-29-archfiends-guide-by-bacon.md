### Introduction  

In this guide I will go over a list of current viable Archfiend builds, their cards, matchup strengths and weaknesses, as well as general advice while playing this archetype. Archfiends are very powerful in the hands of a skilled player and can devastate an opponent’s resources while bolstering your own. The deck is unphased by your opponent’s destruction effects. In fact, we encourage them due to cards like {Call of the Archfiend} and {Archfiend's Roar} allowing us to constantly replenish ourselves from the grave and retain board presence with one of the most imposing deck bosses in the Duel Links meta game.  

It should be noted that each of the 3 current main builds all focus on different plays, set-ups, and seek out different cards throughout the duel. Which build you go after is entirely dependent on your preferred playstyle and the type of deck that you value the most.  

---

### Current Builds  

Currently, Archfiends make the most use out of 3 builds:  

* Dark Worlds  
Dark Worlds and Archfiends have combined to create a true horror from below. This deck is a glass cannon - meaning it foregoes nearly all defense (other than what Call of the Archfiend can provide) and applies immense pressure on your opponent because of the explosive combos. Your opponent may think they are out of the water when they survive a burst from {Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World} only to find out they must deal with {Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror} and Call as well.  

    * Skills: {Duel Standby} and {Restart}  

<br>

* LP Boost a  
{LP Boost a} Archfiends are the 2nd way to play this archetype. This deck focuses on sustained burst plays that control the opponent’s board while also retaining presence with Emperor and {Archfiend Empress}. LP Boost allows us to avoid most OTKs in the meta as well as giving us access to {Card of the Soul} to pull Emperor/Empress from the deck.  

    * Skill: {LP Boost a}  

<br>

* Needlebug Nest   
{Needlebug Nest} provides the third way to play this archetype. Many of the core cards are still the same as LP Boost, but this version is able to quickly flood their grave with large monsters and then combo them with Call/Roar right away. This version offers large OTK potential, but can also fall victim to poor mills. However, it is regarded currently as the most competitive list.  

    * Skill: {Restart}

### Core Cards

This section will cover the relevant monsters and traps the deck uses.  

### Monster Core

[deck](Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror;Archfiend Empress;Archfiend Cavalry;Invader of Darkness)


{Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror}    
Archfiend Emperor is this deck’s boss. He boasts a large statline, can destroy any card on the field once per turn by banishing an Archfiend card (including traps) from the grave or your hand, and can also be summoned without cost from your hand by reducing his stats in half. Granted, he is destroyed during the end phase of that turn, but that only sets up our plays.  

{Archfiend Empress}  
Archfiend Empress boasts considerable stats like the Emperor does. However, we use her in conjunction with Roar which will then trigger her ability to revive an Emperor in the grave at full strength. If Empress is on the field with Emperor, he can rush headlong into anything (including cards like {Sea Stealth Attack} and {Super Rush Headlong}) and she will activate her other ability to banish a monster from the grave and protect Emperor from destruction.  

{Archfiend Cavalry}  
Cavalry is a 1900 beater that is used as fuel for Emperor, fuel for Call, and fuel for Roar. Roar or any other card effect that destroys Cavalry will trigger his Empress-like effect of summoning one of your bosses from the grave at maximum power.  

### Trap cards  

[deck](Call of the Archfiend;Archfiend's Roar;Fiend Griefing)  

{Call of the Archfiend}  
Call of the Archfiend is an amazing continuous trap card that allows us to trade one fiend in hand for any of our high-level fiends in the grave. Additionally, our monsters are not tied to this trap card in any way. This card generates offense as well as defense for the deck.

{Archfiend's Roar}   
Archfiend’s Roar allows us to, at the cost of 500 LP, special summon 1 Archfiend from our grave. This card allows us to trigger both Cavalry and Empress’ effects, saves us from potential OTKs, as well as helping us push for our own.  

{Fiend Griefing}  
Fiend Griefing is more viable in this meta than ever before. Aside from being able to chain to certain effects and disrupt our opponent’s graveyard (i.e. chaining it to {Red-Eyes Spirit} to send a {Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon} back to the deck, sending {Rose Lover} back, {Fishborg Planter}, {Citadel Whale}, etc.), Griefing also allows us to thin our deck and send any fiend of our choice to the grave to set up our combo plays.  

---

### Tech cards
There are currently a number of solid tech cards for the builds that can fit them in.  

1. {Enemy Controller}  
2. {Forbidden Chalice} (Returns a normal summoned Emperor to 3400)  
3. {Ante} (Sets up Griefing and leaves the opponent at 3k LP)  
4. {Dark World Dealings} (Sets grave and thins deck)  
5. {Cosmic Cyclone}  
6. {Kuriboh} (Protection from OTK plays and ECon takes)  
7. {Relinkuriboh} (In the Needlebug Nest build this sees the most value)  
8. {Invader of Darkness} (To shut down quick play spells such as ECon)  
9. {Advance Draw} (Normal summon Emperor, pop card, draw 2)  
10. {Hey, Trunade!}  
11. {Snipe Hunter} (Discards useless Card of the Souls, sets grave, additionally can use a card to pop, then Emperor can use the same card for his effect when it is in the grave)  
12. {Escape from the Dark Dimension} (Banish an Emperor or Empress with Emperors effect to then special summon)  
13. {Gravity Lash} (This card is a perfect side deck choice against Cyber Angels)  
14. {Monster Gate} (Tribute a monster to special summon a random from the deck; has the capability of tributing a Cavalry or Lyla and pulling an Emperor or Empress straight onto the field)  
15. {Skill Successor} (The perfect mill card without losing any value in the grave)  

---

### Playstyle

Dark World hybrid aside, the goal of Archfiends is to consistently retain a board presence with large monsters that do anything from destroy opponent resources (Emperor) to protecting your own (Empress). Typically, the goal is to set your grave as fast as possible with your boss monsters and get to your Call of the Archfiend and Archfiend’s Roar quickly so you can begin to swarm the board while depleting your opponent. OTKs occur often with the deck due to the large attack of your monsters although there is not always a reason to push for it. Sometimes it is better to simply win the battle of resources over time and allow your board to put immense pressure on your opponent. It is also best to assume your opponent will go for ECon take plays and will attempt to Cosmic Cyclone your Call the first chance they get, so be mindful of the deck you are facing and plan two moves ahead. This deck favors preparation and not mindlessly popping your opponent’s cards. Rather, think about what would hurt your opponent the most without opening yourself up simultaneously. Sometimes the right move is just to normal summon Emperor with his effect, set backrow, and then let your opponent make the first move on the board.  

When playing with Needlebug Nest, the goal is to Restart into a hand containing any one of your self mill cards and a Call or Roar to begin your graveyard plays. This deck plays from the graveyard as much if not more than actually playing from the hand. You shouldn’t panic when half of your deck is in the grave. That’s right where you want them to be.

### Matchup Guide

### Aliens
The key to defeating Aliens is to focus on monster removal. Less Aliens play {Brainwashing Beam} now and that heavily plays to our advantage. The key is to watch for ECon take plays and keep track of their A-Counters.  

**Matchup Odds:**  
55-45 Our favor  

---

### Sylvans  
The real reason we are here. Use Emperor or Snipe Hunter to remove any of their set monsters to deny them their effect. The key here is to play around/through {Ultimate Providence} or {Divine Wrath}. Be sure to watch for ECon take plays as well.  

**Match Up Odds:**  
80-20 Our favor  

---
### Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon  
REZ unfortunately gains advantage if we pop any monster other than REZ itself. Therefore, the goal in this matchup is to target their backrow until REZ is on the board. Again, we are bigger, however an ECon take play using {Gozuki} almost certainly spells our demise. Ensure you chain Griefing to their Red-Eyes Spirit whenever you can. Doing so nearly guarantees a win.  

**Match Up Odds:**  
50-50  

---

### Gaia Plate Magnets  
This deck is almost entirely unphased by our destruction effects as it plays to their advantage. Both of their deck bosses are bigger ({Gaia Plate the Earth Giant}’s ability to cut our stats in half) and they can pull them quickly. They run {Powerful Rebirth}s so monster destruction typically does not phase them and if you target their backrow it is usually a chainable ECon or Rebirth anyways. Pray they brick because this is the only deck we truly fear.  

**Matchup Odds:**  
30-70 Strongly their favor  

---

### Sea Stealth Attack  
Use Fiend Griefing to disrupt their Fishborg Planter and Citadel Whale from the grave plays, Emperor + Empress on board near guarantees a win due to Empress protecting Emperor from SSA when he attacks into a Whale. Use Emperor’s effect to force banish and open their board.  

**Matchup Odds:**  
60-40 Our favor  

---

### Cyber Angels 
Whoever goes second has the largest advantage here. All of our bosses are bigger, but a boosted/protected {Saffira, Queen of Dragons} or {Cyber Angel Dakini} can cause major problems. Snipe Hunter is a gamble, but he can steal games by taking out protection spells and big monsters in one turn, or by taking out a protection spell and letting Emperor pop the monster. Once the boosted monster is gone, it is easy to pick these guys off. LP Boost a shines the most in this match. Gravity Lash, Skill Successor, Kuriboh, and Relinkuriboh are all very valuable cards in this matchup.  

**Matchup Odds:**  
45-55  

---

### Fishes  
This is again dependent on who goes second and who draws what. Call this a coin toss. We can easily overpower any of their monsters, but an early {Golden Flying Fish} + {Oyster Meister} combo can clear our entire board with relative ease.  

**Matchup Odds:**  
50-50  

---

### Dinosaurs  
You’re bigger. You’re badder. You make their cards go boom. Look out for ECons, but do not be concerned with things like Super Rush Headlong.  

**Matchup Odds:**  
65-35 Our favor  

---

### Mill  
You can hard brick and still win this most of the time because they will set our grave for us. Just avoid using your own mill cards, let them burn resources doing it for you, remove their monsters, and swing on them whenever possible.  

**Matchup Odds:**  
80-20 Our favor  

---

### Burn
Simply watch for {Lava Golem} (although you can use him as fodder for Advance Draw if need be). Free win.  

**Matchup Odds:**  
90-10 Our favor  

---

### Destiny Heroes
Unfortunately for us, this deck typically runs 3 Enemy Controllers as well as 3 Cosmic Cyclones and quickly puts pressure on us with their insane draw power. Griefing is a shining card here as it can disrupt their graveyard and send {Destiny HERO - Celestial} back to the deck. It is best to focus solely on monster removal in this matchup and to try and bait their Cyclones early to protect your Call of the Archfiend that you will certainly need to win.  

**Matchup Odds:**  
50-50 In their favor  

---

### Masked Heroes
Masked Heroes are quick and explosive and will overwhelm Fiends very fast if able. The best way to win this matchup is too quickly Roar Empress into Invader or call him out of the grave. Once on the field, Invader buys time and shuts down the entire mask deck on his own aside from {Vision HERO - Trinity. Once Invader is on the field, focus on getting an Emperor out to begin the push for game.  

**Matchup Odds:**  
60-40 In Fiends favor if we are running 2 Invaders.   
35-65 Their favor without Invader.  

---

### Geargias
This match is a complete coin toss and depends entirely on who goes first and who opens more broken. While it is possible for Geargia anchor to actually help us with its destruction effect, it can also make Empress miss timing. Because of attacker, we generally will only get 1 use out of call of arch. It's important in this matchup to use emperor's effect almost exclusively on monster removal (their face up monsters). Additionally, archfiend giant sees value here that he doesn't in other matchups as his effect to pay 500lp and remain on the field can harm geargias after they used anchor's effect. Another solid side deck card in this match is lava golem. 2 copies should be enough to shut down geargia after a ties of the brethren play. Ensure that you have used needlebug nest in geargias draw phase so you have roar or call targets for when attacker uses it's effect.  

**Matchup Odds:**  
50-50    

---
### Mirror Match
Archfiends always win this matchup. Whoever establishes their board first nearly always wins this match.  

**Matchup Odds:**  
100% In our favor  

---

### Conclusion
Archfiends boast 2 of the biggest bosses in the current meta and really shine against decks weak to monster removal (rip Glad Beasts). Initially, the deck was not constructed correctly and it took us many hours to get where we are today - finally feeling confident and competitive in the current meta. If played correctly and moves are properly planned in advance, Archfiends can absolutely devastate any opponent they encounter. It has also benefitted us greatly to see Sylvans make the push into the tier list like they have. We may in fact be the only true hope of stopping their evil attempt at conquering the world as we know it.  

### Thanks

To the following players that have stood by this archetype with me since the beginning, helped push the decks forward with the meta, and spent thousands of combined hours testing, thank you and I cannot wait to add more to this as we continue to grow.
