***Disclaimer:*** These cards have not been confirmed by Konami but are in the leaks for the next box. {Geargiaccelerator} and {Geargiano} were leaked in the Syrus Truesdale event so these are discussed as well, but only at the end since it is a separate leak to the box leak.

### Introduction

This deck resolves around monsters which can flip themselves face down and have powerful effects when flipped face up. This deck will be reminiscent of the old clown control deck from 2017. The pack will bring a very strong monster core. It has both monster and backrow destruction and can tutor out any of its monsters. It has swarming potential from the hand and grave. The monsters are all earth machine which gives the deck some amazing tech cards including {Pulse Mines}, {Gravity Blaster}, {Rare Metalmorph}, {Ancient Gear Box} and {Scrap Recycler}.

### Core Geargia Cards

- **{Geargiattacker}** - 1900 beater when flipped face-up destroys Spells and Traps equal to the amount of other Geargia monsters you control. This will be our main form of backrow control. With one other Geargia monster you destroy one Spell or Trap per turn and with two you destroy two. The use of this card will depend on the amount of backrow in the meta. I suspect you will only need two of these since it can be tutored and revived really easily. The backrow destruction effect DOES NOT target so the opponent will be forced to chain before you select which cards to destroy.

- **{Geargianchor}** - 1800 beater when flipped face up destroys monsters equal up to the amount of other Geargia monsters you control. This will be our main form of monster removal. Like {Geargiattacker}, we can destroy up to two monsters per turn. Again you may only need two because the cards can be tutored so easily and revived so easily. The destruction effect DOES NOT target.

- **{Geargiauger}** - This is a weak monster but sets up the deck very well. When it is Normal Summoned you can add 1 Level 4 Earth Machine to your hand from your deck except {Geargiauger}. You cannot attack or Special Summon non-Machine monsters for the rest of the turn. This lets you search out {Geargiattacker} or {Geargianchor} based on what you are missing and is a +1 in card advantage. Unfortunately this monster cannot flip itself face down. I like the card but I think it is too slow. I feel {Geargiarsenal} does this monster's job but much quicker. If I were to use this it would be to ensure I got {Geargiarsenal} on turn one.

- **{Geargiarsenal}** - This is what gets me excited for the deck. This adds a huge amount of consistency by tutoring out any Geargia from the deck and Special Summoning it in defense. You can then flip it face down. This is also the reason I feel two {Geargiattacker} and two {Geargianchor} will be enough. This also sets up the graveyard for {Geargia MKII} plays or {Powerful Rebirth} which this deck may use. This also gains 200 attack for each Geargia monster including itself so it maxes out at 2100 attack, which is enough for game when combined with {Geargiattacker}.

- **{Geargiano Mk-II}** - This card lets you special summon a Geargia from the graveyard when it is normal summoned or flip summoned from the graveyard. This does a lot for the deck since it can recycle {Geargiarsenal} or retrieve dead {Geargiattacker}/{Geargianchor}. Unfortunately you cant toolbox this out with {Geargiarsenal} since its effect doesn’t trigger when special summoned. I think this will a 2 of since it allows you to set up {Geargiattacker} and {Geargianchor} while having 3 Geargia on your second turn. For example, You could {Geargiarsenal} into {Geargiattacker} on turn 1 then on your next turn {Geargiano Mk-II}, summon {Geargiarsenal}, flip up {Geargiattacker} to pop two backrow then summon {Geargianchor} from deck and flip everything down again.

- **{Geargiano Mk-III}** This is a worse {Geargiano Mk-II} because it negates the summoned monster effect so you are basically swarming but for no purpose. I wouldn’t use this at all.

### Synergistic Monsters

- **{Scrap Recycler}** -  This could be a nice one of card. This will let you send {Geargiarsenal} to the grave to set up {Geargiano Mk-II} plays and also to recycle monsters in the late game and draw a card. You will be able to shuffle in dead {Geargiattacker}/{Geargianchor} to re-use them.

 - **{Ancient Gear Box}** - This card can be searched by {Geargiauger} to trigger its effect which will let you search a second {Geargiauger}. I don’t think this has a spot in the deck but it is an interesting interaction nonetheless.

### Synergistic Backrow

The aim of the backrow should be to protect your monsters and avoid OTK plays. Your monsters provide the board control and you will be rarely destroying monsters by battle. Building up a three monster board is important and can be achieved as early as your second turn. There are two main non-staple options and only through testing will we see whether or not both or one of these should be used:

- **{Pulse mines}** - All the monsters in the deck are Machines and {Geargiattacker} has decent stats. What we could do is run triple pulse mines to protect our monsters and stop OTK plays. Then, in our main phase we can flip our monsters face down and flip them back up in the same turn to get their effects off. I feel this will be a key backrow card for the deck. You can chain this to Trunade to stop any OTK plays.

- **{Gravity Blaster}** - Destroys Sylvans and Gladiator Beasts. Negates any monster effect your monster battles with in the battle phase. This has some anti-synergy with the flip-flop nature of the deck but its effect negation will be absolutely worth it to stop cards such as {Sylvan Komushroomo}. It also lets your monsters hit important attack thresholds over multiple turns. This will probably be a key side deck card.

- **{Rare Metalmorph}** - Spell negation and battle step damage increase. It lets your monsters hit important attack thresholds. Again this has anti-synergy with the flip-flop strategy and I don’t think its utility offsets that anti-synergy. Therefore, I don’t think we will use this.

- **{Needle Ceiling}** - This is a new UR trap which destroys all face up monsters on the field if there are four or more. Since we can flip down our important monsters we can gain a lot of advantage from this card. I am unsure if this will go in the main or side since {Geargianchor} does a similar job.

- **{A Feint Plan}** -  This card stops any and all attacks on face down monsters. Since you will be flipping your monsters face down to control the board this card protects all your monsters outside of {Geargiarsenal} and {Geargiano Mk-II} and stops OTK plays. Upon further theorycrafting this card will not suit the playstyle of the deck since to get optimal use of the monsters you will flip-flop in your own turn then attack, leaving your monsters face up at the end of your turn.

### General Backrow

- **{Enemy Controller}** - Amazing versatile card. Offers protection but I doubt we would want to use the 'tribute-take' effect often. However, we can revive from the graveyard with {Geargiano Mk-II} and potentially {Powerful Rebirth}. I personally feel {Paleozoic Canadia} is the better card here.

- **{Floodgate Trap Hole}** -  I think that this card will be important in the deck. {Geargianchor} can destroy face down monsters and the trap slows the opponent down allowing you to build your board. This also offers protection against cards which can destroy or slow down our Geargia monsters such as {Snipe Hunter}, {Citadel Whale}, {Abyss Soldier}, {Golden Flying Fish} and {Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror} to name but a few.

- **{Paleozoic Canadia}** - A more flexible but less powerful {Floodgate Trap Hole} with a graveyard effect we will probably never use. However, since this can chained from the graveyard your opponent will not be able to read toggles as effectively. Unsure if we will use this or {Floodgate Trap Hole} just yet. This card is strictly better than {Enemy Controller} in decks which do not aim to OTK using it.

- **{Curse of Anubis}** - Same reasoning as {Pulse Mines}.

- **Meta Dependant backrow** - {Wall of Disruption}, {Windstorm of Etaqua}, {Divine Wrath}, {Ultimate Providence}, {Mirror Wall} and so on.

### Optimal Skills

- **Restart** - You want to have access to {Geargiarsenal} as soon as possible to kick the deck off. Restart gives you the best chance of getting access to it turn one and allows you to restart any brick hands you may get. This will be the go to skill for sure but balance and more aggressive builds could be good.

- **Balance** - The deck could very easily run balance with an eight monster core of 3 {Geargiarsenal}, 2 {Geargianchor}, 2 {Geargiattacker} and 1 {Scrap Recycler}.

- **Firm as the Earth** - Giving up consistency for greater OTK potential. I doubt we will use this since {Geargiattacker} means we won’t need to use {Cosmic Cyclone} reliably.

### Sample Deck

[deck: Restart](Geargiarsenal; Geargiarsenal; Geargiarsenal; Geargiattacker; Geargiattacker; Geargianchor; Geargianchor; Geargiano Mk-II; Geargiano Mk-II; Scrap Recycler; Floodgate Trap Hole; Floodgate Trap Hole; Floodgate Trap Hole; Pulse Mines; Pulse Mines; Pulse Mines; Paleozoic Canadia; Paleozoic Canadia; Curse of Anubis; Powerful Rebirth)

### Combos and Tips

- Turn 1 summon {Geargiarsenal}, go into either {Geargiattacker} or {Geargianchor} protect it for one turn. Then summon {Geargiano Mk-II}, revive {Geargiarsenal}, flip down {Geargiattacker}/{Geargianchor} and flip it back up to destroy two monsters or backrow. Then tribute {Geargiarsenal} for either {Geargiattacker}/{Geargianchor}.
- When it is not the turn they are summoned, {Geargiattacker} and {Geargianchor} can flip themselves down and flip themselves back face up. Therefore, you will be leaving them face up during your opponents turn. This also allows you to attack. The monsters have great attack stats and can definitely OTK after clearing a field.
- This deck will play and feel like Gladiator Beasts and Flying Fishies but will have a lot more power without sacrificing control or consistency aspects. {Pulse Mines} is an amazing card for shutting down aggressive decks allowing you to retaliate with a board wipe in your turn.
- {Geargiattacker} and {Geargianchor} DO NOT target. This means the opponent will have to chain backrow before you select which cards to destroy. This is huge.
- Writing this guide has given me confidence that this deck will be Tier 1 or 2 since on
paper it has good matchups against the current Meta and Masked Heroes, the other deck with a lot of potential coming from the box.

### Non-Box Leaked Geargia Cards -  Syrus Truesdale Event Leaks

- **{Geargiaccelerator}** - This card was data mined during the Syrus event with full card art so we can assume that this is coming soon either in the box or a card trader card. This card would improve the swarming potential of the deck and also increase consistency since it replaces itself when destroyed. If we get this card we will want to playtest this in place of {Geargiano Mk-II} or {Powerful Rebirth} in the above build. There are advantages to both {Geargiaccelerator} and {Geargiano Mk-II} but I feel that {Geargiaccelerator} will win out in the end for the consistency and speed it offers. However, the {Geargiano Mk-II} combo of putting 3 Geargia
on board including both {Geargiattacker} and anchor should not be overlooked.

- **{Geargiano}** - Terrible card. You can tribute this monster to special summon a Geargia from the grave but its effect is negated. {Geargiano Mk-II} and {Powerful Rebirth} do this cards job but a lot better. The only upside to this is that it is searchable by {Ancient Gear Box} which you won’t be using anyway. The clue is in its name: Geargia**NO**.

### Closing

This will become a full guide when we have the cards and know match ups, builds and techs better. If anyone wants to work on this deck please join the discussion in #Geargia on the DLM Discord or Private Message @Brenduke#0011 on Discord.
