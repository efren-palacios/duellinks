### Overview:

Magnets is an archetype that focuses on milling your rock monsters to the graveyard with the use of {Delta the Magnet Warrior} and {Beta the Electromagnet Warrior}. By doing so, you set-up your special summons and quickly draw into your big plays.  
With the recent release of {That Grass Looks Greener}, a 30 card Magnet deck has taken advantage of its use. Alongside {Triamid Pulse}, the 30 card Grass Magnet deck has taken many by surprise. With the milling capabilities of the Magnet Warrior engine combined with That Grass Looks Greener, Triamid Pulse uses those rock monsters in the graveyard to banish them to activate one of its many effects. 
That being said, with the easy special summon capabilities of {Gaia Plate the Earth Giant} and {Valkyrion the Magna Warrior}, this deck can easily defeat your opponent in one turn or disrupt their entire field.

#### Sample Deck:
Below you can find two successful builds, the first one being a 20 card deck build that recently reached top 4 in the MCS VI. The second is a 30 card That Grass Looks Greener Magnet deck that won the Meta Weekly #7.

### Core Cards:  
These cards are a must in the decks.  
* {Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane} can substitute for every {Powerful Rebirth} you’re missing.
* {Snipe Hunter} or Gamma the Magnet Warrior can be a substitute if you’re missing a Gaia Plate the Earth Giant. 
    * Keep in mind that your deck will lack power late game with fewer Gaia’s in the deck.

### Extra Info
* When activating Beta the Electromagnets first effect, keep track of how many Delta the Magnet Warriors are left in your deck as you don’t want to be forced to add a Beta the Magnet Warrior to your hand. You want Beta the Magnet Warrior in your graveyard, not your hand.
* Try to save Beta the Electromagnets second effect until the your opponent's end phase, that way you can prevent any targeting effects on it during your opponent's turn. 
* Before sending Delta the Magnet Warrior to your graveyard to special summon Valkyrion the Magna Warrior, check to see if you have the correct monsters in the graveyard first (3 Magnet warriors but none can be Delta the Magnet Warrior).
* When special summoning Gaia Plate the Earth Giant before Valkyrion the Magna Warrior, try to banish Delta the Magnet Warriors from your graveyard as fuel for Gaia Plate the Earth Giant because if you banish 2 of the 4 possible monsters needed for Valkyrion (1 Electromagnet and 3 Beta), he then becomes a dead card.
