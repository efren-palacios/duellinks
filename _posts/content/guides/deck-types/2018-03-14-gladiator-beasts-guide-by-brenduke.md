### Introduction & History
Gladiator Beasts have a long and rich history throughout the Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game. They were first released in Japan with the Gladiator's Assault booster pack on July 21, 2007. The Gladiators dominated the TCG throughout 2008 and were the winners of the Yu-Gi-Oh World Championship that year. Gladiator Beasts were released in Duel Links in the pack Galactic Origin and have been a common fixture on the ladder and in tournaments since. 

The Gladiator Beasts use a mechanic in Yu-Gi-Oh commonly referred to as “tagging out”. This is a fan created term referring to special summoning a Gladiator Beast at the end of the battle phase from the deck by returning a Bladiator Beast that attacked or was attacked. The second mechanic that Gladiator Beast use is called Contact Fusion. This is fusion conducted by returning monsters from the field to the deck to special summon from the extra deck without using cards like {Polymerization}. The deck uses a small monster core supported by a strong suite of spells and traps which protect the Gladiators to support the tagging out mechanic, generating card advantage and removing threats from the opponent’s board. It is important to note that a Gladiator Beast cannot tag itself in, for example, you cannot tag out {Gladiator Beast Murmillo} to summon Gladiator Beast Murmillo.

The Gladiator Beast deck is easy to use but difficult to master; this deck punishes the pilot’s mistakes and rewards optimal play. Gladiator Beasts have been an important aspect of the metagame for almost half a year, since our decks core engine is small (7-9 monsters) and can run any backrow card our builds can be incredibly versatile and adapt to anything Konami throws at us. If we can survive Abyss Encounters and come out strong, we can survive anything. The recent addition of side decking in community events improves our versatility even more so you should always be prepared to face Gladiators in a tournament. 

### About the Author
Brenduke played the TCG competitively up until 2010 and achieved multiple regional tops in the UK with Gladiator Beasts. He only quit the TCG due to starting University which meant that time and money became more restricted. When Duel Links was released he was instantly hooked and has achieved King of Games six times so far, four of which were with Gladiator Beasts. He has topped multiple tournaments and popularized 3SD Gladiators. He is currently Deck Expert for Gladiator Beasts in the Duel Links Meta Discord. 

Green played the TCG competitively for years. He comes up with original and creative deck ideas, completely new to the meta. He has achieved King of Games multiple times, and is currently the head coach for Creeping Death in Team Wars. He focuses heavily on deck analysis, and meta prediction to spur creativity. He has actively posted in the Gladiator Beast discord channel since its inception.

### A Guide to the Guide
This will be a living guide which will be updated once per month to reflect new card releases and changes in the metagame. The guide has three main sections:
* **Building Your Gladiator Beast Deck**   
    * In this section we discuss the cards which form the core of the deck, the spells and traps the deck can use effectively and some tech options.
* **The Gladiator Beast skills guide**   
    * This section discusses the top 5 skills for gladiator beasts and provides a link to the main skills guide which discusses 23 different skills we can use.
* **The match up guide**   
    * Firstly, we will discuss the mirror match in depth. This is a good place to start since it will also teach you some core mechanics of the deck. 
    * We then go onto to discuss how we fare against the Tier 1-3 decks as defined by Duel Links Meta and the Top Player Council. 
    * A separate guide discusses ladder matchups which can be found in #gladiator-tips on the DLM Discord.

### Building your Gladiator Beast Deck
This section will cover the relevant monsters, spells and traps the deck uses. It will not discuss in any length cards we do not often use, for example, Augustus, Secutor and Alexander will not discussed in detail.

### Monster Core
You will want to run 8 monsters in your deck but you can move this to 9 if you wish for non-balance builds.
[deck](Gladiator Beast Laquari;Gladiator Beast Laquari;Gladiator Beast Laquari;Gladiator Beast Bestiari;Gladiator Beast Bestiari;Gladiator Beast Murmillo;Gladiator Beast Murmillo;Gladiator beast Dimacari)


Gladiator Beast Laquari [Optimal Count 3]
Gladiator Beast Laquari is our highest attack monster and is key to the tagging out strategy. He is the monster you always want to draw or topdeck. Laquari’s attack has now been powercrept by cards like volcanic rocket but he remains important. Many of our spells and traps change battle positions or lower attack therefore he is important for destroying monsters through battle. His ability to tag in either bestiari or murmillo is important and makes him a toolbox in his own right. When he is tagged in his attack is boosted to 2100 allowing him to beat over unbooted hazy flame sphinx and many other relevant monsters. Finally, you need laquari to summon heraklinos, the decks boss monster which will be very relevant in some matches. You want three laquari, but you can play the deck with only two if you are free to play.

Gladiator Beast Bestiari [Optimal Count 2]
Bestiari is our primary source of backrow removal and one of the key ways the deck generates advantage and drains opponent’s resources. His low attack means that you will more often than not need to protect him from battle. Since you want to tag into Bestiari it is important to run two so that you do not draw it as often as liquari or dimacari. The reason you do not want to run one is that if he was to be destroyed you lose your backrow removal and there are situations where tagging into two bestiari to clear backrow comes up. Some players argue that three bestiari without a dimacari is optimal, if you think this ask yourself the question: Would I rather draw bestiari or dimacari? 

Gladiator Beast Murmillo [Optimal Count 1-2]
Murmillo is our weakest monster but also one of the most important. This monster allows us to destroy any monster on the field when he is tagged in and can remove large threats like ancient gear golem, Red eyes zombie dragon and valkyrion the magna warrior. You will very often be able to tag in murmillo after destroying a monster in battle to clear two monster in a turn or retaliate to destroy a monster in your opponents turn after using impenetrable attack. Murmillo is a poor card to draw since he requires protection and often you will taking a sizeable hit to your life points to tag him out. For the exact same reasons as bestiari, we recommend using two. Although, you can drop murmillo to one if you are main decking other forms of removal such as super rush headlong or the metagame favours targeting immune monsters such as hazy flame or citadel whale.

Gladiator beast Dimacari [optimal count 1-2]
Dimacari rounds out the core monster line up and is often seen as the weakest viable gladiator we have but he serves an important purpose. Firstly he serves a similar function to liquari in that he is a toolbox since he tag into bestiary, murmillo and liquari. Do not ignore his tagged in effect, Dimacari puts a lot of pressure on the opponent and can close out games when the opponent is top decking. He can destroy up to two monsters per turn with cards such as windstorm of equita, curse of Anubis or super rush headlong. He also threatens a whopping 3200 damage if not dealt with. If you choose to use only one murmillo, dimacari I the best option to replace it as the 8th monster.

2.1 Spell cards
Note: The spells we use and optimal counts will vary significantly based on the current meta, The current guide was written for March 2018. We will go in depth on how to use these cards in the match up sections.

Enemy Controller
Super Rush Headlong
Gravity Lash
Cosmic Cyclone

Enemy Controller [Optimal Count: 3]
Gladiator Beasts generally want to attack defence position monsters. Enemy controller achieves this while also offering a lot of extra utility. Firstly, enemy controller can protect a monster from battle by switching the attacker to defence position which also allows us to follow this up with an attack and begin tagging out. This card is a -1 in card advantage on paper but in reality the gladiator effects make it an even trade or a +1 if we destroy the opponent’s monster by battle. Being a quickplay spell means we use it defensively or offensively. Finally, the second effect of enemy controller opens up OTK plays or can be used to primitively stop effects such as cyber angel dakini, snipe hunter and golden flying fish. This card is also the key to winning the mirror match as we will discuss later. Being a quickplay also means we can chain it to backrow removal or pinning.

Super Rush Headlong [Optimal Count: 2]
Super rush headlong is a card we use often despite it having little synergy with our monsters. Super rush headlong complements our low attack monsters and can be used offensively or defensively to destroy threats outside of battle. The card is also important in that it doesn’t target and is one of our only outs to a boosted hazy flame sphinx or citadel whale. Being able to destroy outside of battle also allows us to remove aliens from the board without having to worry about A-counter on our monster or getting A-counters from alien warrior. This spell is also one of the cards used to counter gladiator beasts. Due to turn player priority, the turn player’s super rush headlong will always win. Therefore, if you are attacking a defence position monster and your opponent responds with this card you can chain your own copy which destroys your opponent’s monster while also saving your own! Like enemy controller, this card has all the benefits of being a quickplay spell.

Cosmic Cyclone [Optimal Count 0-3]
Simple, versatile, effective 1 for 1 backrow removal. This is an incredibly versatile card and in the current meta (March 2018) you should be main decking this card for the ladder and side decking it for tournaments. Cosmic cyclone can simply remove set backrow so that your gladiators can effectively attack or can be used to remove matchup specific threats such as a legendary ocean, brain washing beam, ancient gear castle, goyukku, xing zen hu, ninjitsu traps and powerful rebirth. If you are taking a pot shot at backrow this is best used in the end phase on a card the opponent set that turn where the opponent cannot chain that set card. Also not that this card does not negate so banishing in response to wall of disruption will not stop it going through. However, you may wish to chain this to spells or traps with graveyard effects to stop those occurring, for example, hymm of light, cyber angel ritual and A-cell recombination device. This card can be used to trigger skills but can also turn off mind scan.

2.3 Trap cards
Note: The traps we use and optimal counts will vary significantly based on the current meta, the current guide was written for March 2018. We will go in depth on how to use these cards in the match up sections.
Floodgate Trap Hole
Impenetrable Attack
Wall of Disruption
Mirror Wall
Curse of Anubis
Windstorm of Etaqua

Floodgate Trap Hole [Optimal Count: 3]
This is one of the best generic trap cards in the game and is an important trap for the gladiator beast deck. This card fulfils many jobs for the deck. Firstly, it slows down the opponent and forced them to play at your pace. Secondly, it gives us a face-down defence position monster to attack into and begin tagging. Being face down is important since it prevents the use of cards such like super rush headlong. Finally, it also shuts down monster effects. For example, you can shut down gozuki, snipe hunter, lava golem, cyber angel dakini, alien telepath, golden flying fish and abyss soldier to name but a few. It also permanently puts large monsters into defence so we can hold off a large attack until we can pop it with a murmillo tag. One thing to recognise with floodgate trap hole is that it can actually open up an alternative win condition for the deck if you are using three complemented with wall of disruption. Many decks do not run tribute monsters and you can actually go for a deck out victory against a deck like volcanic snipe hunter, aliens (if you hit overlord) and magnets. Some players prefer two and have success with two but it is my personal opinion that three is optimal since you want it turn one.

Impenetrable Attack [Optimal Count: 0-2]
This cards usage is heavily dependent on the meta but is something you should always consider when building your deck. Right now this card is seeing a lot of play because it allows you to be play completely passively against aliens and force them to make attacks. Setting this and a GB while using balance also allows you to bluff being an alien player where you will see many players attacking right into the trap. The key reason impenetrable attack is good right now is because super rush headlong usage is relatively high, mysterious triangle is seeing play in the battle phase and this card can stop sea stealth attacks destruction effect. This card can be used both offensively and defensively. Its second effect does not see much use but it can stop OTKs. That said, I find that if I am in a situation where I need to use the second effect I have already lost.

Wall of Disruption [Optimal Count: 0-2]
Again this card enters and falls out of the meta as if it is a cyclical card. You usually play either this card or impenetrable attack. In a meta with little backrow removal and swarming decks this card is one of the best options any deck can use. The current meta has a lot of decks which can swarm the field such as red eyes zombies, cyber angels, magnet warriors, aliens and destiny heroes. This card in conjunction with floodgate trap hole opens up the secondary win condition of decking the opponent out. In some match ups it is best to bait out a big wall of disruption play to clog the opponent’s field with 0 attack monsters and then stall out to victory. Remember, Gladiators have a natural anti-deck out option in Essedari. 

Mirror Wall [Optimal Count: 0-2]
Mirror wall is a card that has fallen out of favour in recent months but I have included it as a core trap since it functions in a similar way to wall of disruption but has some notable advantages. Firstly, this card is better when the opponent only has one monster, secondly, this card can be chained to sergeant electro who is still around even if his usage has dropped recently and finally, and possibly the most important point is that mirror wall is much harder to play around compared to disruption and can be used to confuse your opponent in the toggle game. Since this sees little use it comes as a surprise to the opponent and often results in you destroying a monster by battle and their second monster or a spell or trap they set that turn. Remember to activate this in the damage step. It is also important to know when to pay to keep mirror wall active for a second turn. You will probably want to use this over disruption is using skill like no mortal can resist.

Curse of Anubis [Optimal Count: 1]
This is a staple trap for the deck. Like floodgate trap hole, this achieves two things. It protects your monsters while also turning opponent’s monsters to defence which allows you to get some tagging plays off. Another big bonus this card has is that it is chainable to cards like cosmic cyclone and storm. It can also be used before the battle phase to counter a suspected anti-magic arrows play. Remember that this card only hits effect monsters so some cards are immune to it. This includes ancient gear knight, gladiator beast andal and heavy knight of flame all of which see play. This is one of the most powerful and versatile traps in the game and you should be using the one copy we have access to.

Windstorm of Etaqua [Optimal count 0-1]
This card is very similar to curse of Anubis but also hits normal and gemini monsters. This card comes in and out of favour since it is easy to play around if your opponent makes the correct read. The second issue with the card over curse of Anubis is that if your opponent is playing around WoD they are also naturally playing around windstorm. That said, it remains a very powerful option for all the reasons stated above for curse of Anubis. You will usually be playing this but it can be dropped to fit in another copy of wall of disruption.

2.4 Hand Traps

Sphere Kuriboh

Sphere Kuriboh [Optimal Count 0-3]
Sphere kuriboh is yet another amazing defensive option for the deck covering some of the uses which enemy controller and floodgate trap hole offer. While this card is not as strong as the aforementioned cards it does have its merits in some metas. This card is immune to backrow removal and anti-magic arrows, this card also does not target and is therefore a strong card. It is very strong in matchups which aim to OTK or have a lot of backrow removal like red eyes zombies, cyber angels, control decks and dinosaurs. Unfortunately, this card can cause bricks with balance but it is a very good choice for non-balance builds.

2.5 The Extra Deck
The Gladiator extra deck will not change unless new gladiator beast fusion monsters are released. These will come but not in the foreseeable future since they are either too strong (Gyzarus) or their fusion materials are arguably too strong (Gaiodiaz which requires Hoplomus).

Gladiator Beast Essedarii
Gladiator Beast Essedarii
Gladiator Beast Essedarii
Gladiator Beast Nerokius
Gladiator Beast Heraklinos

Gladiator Beast Essedarii [Optimal Count: 3]
At first glance Essedarii feels weak and does not offer anything other than being a 2500 beatstick. However, he has proven himself to be a very versatile addition to the deck. For example, with two Essedarii in the extra deck you can continuously summon him by using Essedari and one other gladiator as material preventing you from ever decking out. This is important for the burn and stall matchups we will discuss later. This also provides the deck with its second win condition in deck out which can be achieved against a surprising number of decks when we consider floodgate trap hole and wall of disruptions effectiveness. Note: You can fuse using face down/floodgated monsters and those effected by massivemorph/wall of disruption/inverse universe to clear those effects from your field. 

Essedari also allows you to beat over the multitude of 2200-2400 attack monsters in the current meta such as red eyes zombie dragon, sacred phoenix, alien overlord and citadel whale, legendary fisherman II and mecha sea dragon peilson (assuming you have an answer to sea stealth attack).

Gladiator Beast Nerokius [Optimal Count: 1]
Commonly referred to as Batman by the community, nerokius is one of our two boss monsters which are very rarely summoned. Nerokius is an important card for closing out games and being able to attack into cards like sea stealth attack, des counterblow, wall of disruption and many other non-chainable backrow. He can also present a huge brick wall to the opponent since he is very tough to take due to battle phase immunity.
Tip: Nerokius stops any card that starts a chain. Continuous effects which would cause a chain to start do not activate on attack (e.g. des counterblow would cause destruction, which always starts a chain) but those continuous effects which don’t cause chain still activate (e.g. toon kingdom banishing a card from the top of a deck doesn’t start a chain)
Tip: Don’t summon him into a floodgate trap hole
Tip: After attack declaration, you can activate cards and your opponent cannot respond to them. For example, cosmic cyclone or e-con take cannot be responded to if it is done during the battle step after attacking with nerokius.

Gladiator Beast Heraklinos [Optimal Count: 1]
Like Neorkius, you won’t be summoning heraklinos often but in the 5% of games you do he will win you that game. I discuss using Heraklinos in detail in the mirror match section of the guide so I won’t go into it in detail here. In long, grindy games heraklinos can be summoned to close that game out. He is also very strong against stall and burn decks but trying to summon him is a risk due to lava golem. One thing heraklinos is really good at is ending the game. E.g. if you have more cards in hand than your opponent has backrow summoning herkalinos is probably going to secure your victory. Don’t summon heraklinos if your behind on resources since the opponent will force negations and eventually remove him.

2.6 Tech cards
These cards are main and side deck options which work well in certain matchups. These will not be discussed in the same detail as the core cards but they will be mentioned in the matchup guides.

2.6.1 Monsters
•	D.D. Warrior: The holy guard variant of gladiator beasts will often use 2-3 D.D warrior. This card provides the best monster removal in the game at the cost of a normal summon. It was more popular in heavy CA meta where you could crash into dakini or Saffira and bypass all protection. The card can also banish gozuki, red eyes zombie dragon, valkyrion and ancient gear golem and other large threats.
•	Sargent Electro: Only really used with mind scan and mighty as fire. Electro offers disruption by forcing early backrow plays and pinning unchainables down. Electro quickly becomes the centre of attention and forces the opponent to burn resources removing him. 
•	Four star ladybug of doom: In my opinion this is the best side deck card since it is very good against legendary ocean deck when combined with inpenetrable attack, aliens, dinosaurs, little city destiny heroes, magnets and the mirror match. This is a side deck card since it is useless in some matchups.
•	Jowels of dark demise: A very good card in the mirror. Set it and let your opponent attack into it, then you can tag out their gladiator at the end of the battle phase. This is a huge swing play and a great side option when gladiators are popular. 
•	Heavy knight of flame: Similar in function to d.d. warrior but is slower to set up at the cost of having more long term utility.
•	Lava golem: You can tribute off two monsters your opponent controls to summon this in defence position. You can then attack golem and destroy it with murmillo. Good for clearing untargetable threats such as whale and hazy. Golem + e-con take is also an OTK move against very aggressive decks which run little backrow.

2.6.2 Spells
•	Anti-magic arrows: Functions in a similar way to cosmic cyclone at the moment and is a good replacement if you don’t have any. The added benefit of AMA is free tagging in the battle phase which can be devastating since bestiary cannot be chained to.
•	Forbidden chalice: Good all round card now that we have reached an effect monster meta. The extra 400 attack can come in clutch but do not tag out if you chaliced your own monster. Also don’t expect boosted liquari to jump to 2500 it will go to 2200. 
•	Forbidden dress: An okay side deck card which prevents targeting and monster destruction. Note: dress will not negate an effect which has already targeted. (e.g. chaining to enemy controller)
•	My body as a shield: This card stops monster destruction from any source outside of battle but comes with a heavy cost. This is good against sea stealth attack, snipe hunter, murmillo, archfiend emperor and mysterious triangle to name a few. Best used with LP reduction skills such as bandit. Better in the side deck
•	Fire formation Goyukku: Very useful if you don’t have cosmic cyclones. It also boosts liquari to 1900 which helps in the mirror match. Really good in conjunction with mind scan.
•	Zombie world: Shuts down hazy flame decks and monarch decks which are both very difficult matchups. A good side option but might not be the best use of the spot.
•	Foolish return: A good side deck card against red eyes zombies and aliens. We can force spirit/rebirth activation with bestiary and chain this from the hand to ruin their play. I personally feel disappear is better in the GB side as it is an automatic win vs stall/burn if used.
•	Acid rain/system down: If ancient gears come back into the meta this is a good side card
2.6.3 Traps
•	Blast held by tribute: A nasty and brutal surprise against hazy flame players. This is like acid rain in the ancient gear match-up.
•	Xing Zeng Hu: This trap can be devastating against other control decks, burn, aliens and the mirror. Resolving this in the end phase of your opponents turn will usually win you the match, but it is dead vs other. I like this in the main deck when using 3SD GB.
•	Straight flush: We all say how well Glading used this in MCSVI where he sided this in his tournament winning deck. Amazing vs aliens, GB and burn who often set 3.
•	Divine wrath/ultimate providence: These traps offer monster effect negation at the cost of a discard. This is good in the side for snipe hunter where negating its effect is an even trade. 
•	Disappear: Most top players see this as an inferior version of foolish return and for good reason. However, I strongly feel disappear is better for gladiator beasts specifically because it gives you guaranteed win vs stall.
•	Kunai With Chain: Often forgotten card but I like to compare it to enemy controller in that it is a versatile card which can do sphere or e-cons defending job or be activated in the damage step to surprise the opponent. It also opens up Dimicari OTK plays. Its situational activation requirement for the defence change has kept it out of the main deck so far.
•	Powerful rebirth: A good option if facing decks with a lot of out of battle monster destruction to recover lost gladiators. Tagging out the summoned gladiator does clog your backrow so use with caution. 
•	Regulation of tribe: can be used to stall for a turn after been hit by Hey, trunade!
•	Rebound: If Hey, Trunade! Becomes a meta staple then this is the ultimate counter to it.

2.8 Rampage of the forest new card discussion

Gravity Lash
Hey, Trunade!
Memory Loss
Spikeshield with chain

Gravity Lash
This is quick play spell reminiscent of shrink from the TCG which was often in the gladiator beat main deck. This card can be used in the damage step. Therefore, it can be used aggressively in such a way that enemy controller and super rush headlong cannot since the opponent must use a resource to stop the attack before the damage step if they suspect you have this card. The only other relevant damage step effects, mirror wall, chalice and destiny hero dangerous all offer attack reduction/increases lower to the decrease of this card. 

If we examine the current metagame the only monsters which are not significantly impaired by this card is samurai skull and hazy flame monsters. Additionally, sea stealth attack destroys before this card becomes relevant… but if we use cosmic cyclone it is rarely an issue. let’s take our weakest monster, Murmillo. Using gravity lash on the following monsters means even murmillo can attack over them: Red eyes zombie dragon, dakini, valkyrion, alien overlord, citadel whale, legendary fisherman, abyss soldier, saffira and ancient gear golem to name but a few. 

But why would you use gravity lash over super rush headlong? Two reasons: 1: You can force backrow by playing aggressively which SRH cannot because it can be chained to meaning it is often a 1-1 trade whereas the threat of lash itself can create +1s. But the most important point is that we can tag out after using this. We will be destroying the monster in battle (or removing graveyard protection) AND tagging in bestiari/murmillo to gain advantage or liquari to generate tempo.

This card is THE BEST support gladiator beasts have received in months and this card will open up more aggressive builds and allow us to make better counter plays to the next new card to consider: Hey Trunade! This rare spell has the chance to become a core x3 spell and change the way we build and play gladiators completely.

Hey, Trunade!
This card presents both opportunities and threats to gladiator beasts. Many players are acting as though this card spells the end to the gladiator archtype but they couldn’t be more wrong. How long have we survived while storm and anti-magic arrows have been meta-relevant? This is a stronger version of these cards since it is quicker (storm) and returns main phase one backrow (floodgate, curse of Anubis, e-con etc.) back to the hand before they can be used.

This card will be mainly used in OTK decks and will lead to a big resurgence of cyber angels, improves REZD OTK plays and will be used by new OTK builds in the upcoming set (gigaplant gemini decks specifically). If this card sees a lot of play (it will for a while) then we will need to switch to a restart build utilising spheres.  But, this card presents opportunities for us as well. Firstly, we can use the card to clear backrow like we have used anti-magic arrows in the past but this card does have less synergy and secondly may lead to a reduction in backrow heavy decks and other backrow harming cards. Which are both good for us. 

Would you rather have your backrow returned to your hand or pinned down or destroyed? Don’t let this card discourage you, we have been dealing with cards like this for months.

Memory Loss
The closest comparison to this card which we currently have is forbidden chalice. At first glance this card looks amazing for our decks and had the potential to be a core card. However, upon closer inspection it only negates one activation of the effect. Therefore, cards like snipe hunter and golden flying fish can activate their effects again. 

But for cards other than this, such as dakini, gozuki, samurai skull, alien telepath, alien overlord, delta, beta, volcanic rocket and ritual searchers this card is strong if used on them on the turn they are summoned (so they cannot just switch back to attack). This card may become an important side deck card for us, but only through testing will we learn if it is better or worse than chalice.

Spikeshield with chain

Another damage step trap with good potential. 500 attack allows our monsters to be able to hit important attack stat thresholds and can act is an impenetrable attack in a way since our set gladiator’s defence will rise higher than most monsters in the meta. For example, with this card dimicari has 3300 defence (and can threaten an OTK if tagged in), bestiari would have 2800 defence and liquari would have 2700 defence. Those are impressive stats to hit.  This card fits into the more aggressive playstyle that gravity lash encourages as well. 
Note: if using in Three star demotion (3SD) build Sanga defence would go to 5300 and be an outright OTK to the decks which don’t have an out to set Sanga.  (3SD GB might be a good way to play the deck after the new box).

3.0 Gladiator Beast Skills Discussion
This guide will examine the many potential skills that gladiator beasts will use, highlight their advantages and disadvantages and why you might want to use that in a specific META. Gladiator beasts are by far the most versatile deck in duel links because the core of the deck is small with only 7-8 monsters being mandatory. This means the deck has twelve spots for tech options which can be adapted to any Meta we are in. Gladiator’s versatility also comes from the huge number of skills which work with them. In total the main skills guide identifies and analyses 23 skills which the deck can use. Each of which will influence how the deck is built and will vary in usefulness based on the current metagame. 
Here is the link to the main skills guide: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYpKiRPyDlZ7yQhlL2GiD-64JLwYT_KV/view.

3.2 How might the new box, rampage of the forest effect skill choice? 
The meta is beginning to fill up with graveyard effects yet again. Therefore shadow game and no mortal can resist have re-entered the top five skills list. Balance and Mind scan remain the dominant skills. Endless trap hell remains in the top five due to its stall power and deck out victory potential. 
The new box, rampage of the forest looks to further the metagames reliance on graveyard effects even further with the introduction of power cards such as gigaplant and doom dozer. Furthermore, destiny heroes and flying fish are somewhat reliant on the graveyard. Furthermore, the introduction of trunade is likely to increase the representation of OTK decks such as red eyes zombies and cyber angels both of which rely in the graveyard. Therefore, NMCR looks to be a top anti-meta option. 

If trunade sees high usage as we expect then switching to a build using sphere kuriboh may be recommended. In this case, restart will replace balance as our key consistency skill. Though we have high consistency using 8 or 9 monsters so restart may not be needed unless you wish to dig for specific cards such as sphere or mirror wall.

3.3: Top 5 skills going into Rampage of the Forest 

1: Restart: Restart may take over balance as the decks dominant consistency skill because Hey, Trunade! improves the consistency of OTK focused decks like cyber angels and red eyes zombies. Therefore, we will probably want to switch to a build utilizing multiple sphere kuribohs.
2 No Mortal Can Resist This skill turns all monsters in the graveyard into skull servants and can be activated every turn as long as your life points are 1000 lower than the opponents. This skill shuts down the new d-hero decks, doom dozer insect builds, gigaplant gemini builds and sylvians not to mention red eyes zombies and magnet warriors while also impairing aliens, CA, fishies and hazy to a lesser extent. You will also be using CC to trigger the skill so you will be effective against SSA as well.
3: Balance: I am not ruling our best skill out just yet. You can still use one sphere and mirror walls with this skill.
4: Mind Scan: This skills usefulness will fall initially as people drop some backrow due to trunade fear and increased sphere usage but may rise in usefulness again if control decks do survive in the OTK meta truande offers.
5: Three Star Demotion: I think in the upcoming meta we will need to be more aggressive than before and 3SD Sanga fits the bill perfectly. I had a lot of success with this skill when CA usage was high and it looks to be making a comeback with trunade.

3.4 Popular Skills for Gladiator beasts

Balance
Traditionally, balance has been the most popular skill because it allows you to manipulate your opening hand to always open with one gladiator beast and two backrow cards. One useful tip for balance is to play eight monsters, six spells and six traps. This way you have a guaranteed chance to draw one Gladiator, one spell and one trap. Therefore, if you run three floodgate trap hole and three wall of disruption you have a 50% chance to draw either. Furthermore, if you play three enemy controller and three super rush headlong you have a 50% chance to open with either. This means you will always open with a good card against Saffira cyber angels and one card which is good in the mirror match. The issue with balance is that it removes sphere kuriboh as an option. Looking towards the future, balance’s power will decrease as more hand traps such as effect veiler release. Balance’s future as our dominant skill may be limited by the influx of out of battle monster destruction and trunade both of which hinder our preference to open with 1 monster 3 backrow. We will usually prefer 2 monsters 2 backrow going forward.

Mind Scan
Mind scan is perhaps the second most popular skill after balance for the archtype and for good reason. Mind scan allows you to see all of your opponents face down cards as long as you maintain over 3000 life points which is fairly easy to do given all the backrow the deck has access to. Mind scan was nerfed in February 2018 to only activate on the third turn. This has reduced the potency of the skill and some players now dismiss its usefulness because it isn’t activate during the most important part of the game. This is false however as gladiator beasts can often run long matches and being able to see and play around all backrow (to an extent) is a very powerful skill. It is particularly useful on the ladder and in side deck tournaments so you can see the tech cards your opponent is playing. For example, in MSC V I was knocked out by Ewe_Surname because his mind scan skill revealed that I had sided in four star ladybugs of doom in the (mind scan) mirror match. As a result he was able to play around it by fusing into essedari. No matter how good you are at reading activation prompts only mind scan stop you falling into a trap such as this. One concern I have with the new mind scan skill is that it heavily favours going first so you have it active on your first attacking turn. Going second you will not have it activate for both your set up and first attacking turn.

No Mortal can resist
NMCR is an amazing skill in the right meta-game. Discord member Xanxus made an excellent read on the meta and got second place in the Meta weekly tournament using the skill and the below list. No mortal can resist turns all monsters in the graveyards into skull servants. This is particularly good versus red eyes zombie dragon decks which are currently tier one and magnet warriors. The skill is also really strong against any deck which uses powerful rebirth such as aliens and flying fish. Furthermore, the new decks coming out of rampage of the forest are all reliant on the graveyard. No mortal can resist absolutely destroys decks reliant on the graveyard and naturally needs to run cosmic cyclone giving it a good matchup against SSA water as well. I anticipate this to be one of the premier GB skills going forward. However, in the mirror match and against decks like dinosaurs this has no use.

4.0 Mastering the mirror match

General tips for the mirror
Generally, you want to play the mirror match passively. The first player to make a mistake is the one who loses in the mirror match. You should only attack when it is safe to do so but how do you determine this? Firstly, you will want to scout your opponent’s backrow by paying attention to delays during either players turn. Dkayed created a perfect delay guide which I have included in the appendix of this guide for you to reference while playing and also while reading this guide. Alternatively, you can use the skill I ranked as having the most utility, mind scan which will allow you to dominate the mirror match. Note, the delay guide is useful even when using mind scan for when your LP drop below 3000.
•	It is not safe to attack when you suspect wall of disruption, impenetrable attack, mirror wall or super rush headlong (if their monster is face up) if you DO NOT have enemy controller or impenetrable attack yourself. 
•	It is often not safe to attack if you suspect the opponent has their own enemy controller and impenetrable attack or if they control at least two gladiator beast monsters without impenetrable attack.
•	It is safe to attack if you only suspect sphere kuriboh, curse of Anubis, windstorm of equita, super rush headlong (if opponent monster is face down) AND have some form of protection for a defence position gladiator(s). 
•	It is often safe to attack into a suspected enemy controller if the opponent is not in a position to capitalise on an e-con take play in an attempt to get the opponent to waste the enemy controller.
•	If two Gladiator beast players are both experienced in the mirror match the match will often be long without many attacks occurring. As a result, Heraklinos and Nerokius plays are more common than in any other match up.
•	If you suspect floodgate trap hole DO NOT summon Nerokius without a backup play (such as Liquari. It almost always is a bad idea to get Nerokius floodgated, but remember nerokius has battle destruction immunity and can tag out. To win, your opponent will have to attack into nerokius at some point. They will do this only if they think it is safe to either a) attack then murmillo Nerokius and b) if they have an e-con take play. You should try and set up your own enemy controller or impenetrable attack ready for the inevitable attack into nerokius.
•	If your opponent’s backrow and hand combined is less than the number of cards in your backrow and hand Herkalinos is a safe play. For example, if the opponent has 3 backrow cards and 2 in hand and you also have 3 backrow but three cards in hand heraklinos is a strong play and can win you the mirror since he negates every backrow card (including floodgate on his own summon) and other gladiators except nerokius cannot take him down.
•	You do not need to negate every backrow card. For example, if Herkalinos is your only monster and you get hit by a wall of disruption while you have backrow protection for him you can let the wall through. A 2200 Heraklinos is still a lot to deal with for GB. In this situation you have conserved one resource which can mean the difference between winning and losing the game. The reason I say to only not negate wall in this situation if you have backrow (preferably position changing, WoD or MW or floodgate) is because the opponent could respond with Essedari and you will need to protect a 2200 Heraklinos. 
•	If you are in top decking mode, Essedarii is a viable play since your opponent will need a gladiator and backrow to deal with it.

Using Enemy controller in the mirror
As long as gladiator beasts remain popular then three enemy controller is mandatory even in the endless trap hell build which favours traps to spells. This card is the key to winning the mirror match. One thing we are beginning to see is the inclusion of gladiator beast Andal in side decks and on the ladder in decks such as REZD and Ancient gears. That is testament to how strong this card is gladiator beasts.
Enemy controller can be used to tribute your monster to gain control of an opponent’s gladiator which has already battled. This allows you to send your opponents monster back into their deck and special summon on from yours. This means that you have removed your opponent’s gladiator and in most situations destroy their second gladiator or a backrow card. This play does not generate card advantage (-1 GB, - e-con, +GB +destruction effect) but is a huge tempo swing especially if you can Murmillo a second monster.
Here is the discord’s gladiator beast expert, Raytee’s comment on how to use enemy controller in the mirror match. There is no point repeating what is already out there!
“With econ, you can attack their gladiator, if they impenetrable attack, you then have 2 choices: 1. tag out your gladiator for another (like Bestiari) THEN econ take their monster to tag out their Gladiator. 2. If they have econ then you MUST econ after the successful attack and not attempt to tag out your gladiator. Why? If they are smart and have their toggle ON (this is what YOU need to do if on the receiving end), when you choose to end the battle phase, they will have the chance to ECON take your monster before you are able to tag out.
Econ take to tag out/fuse your opponent's gladiator is devastating no matter how you are able to pull it off.”

Using toggle in the mirror match & turn player priority 
This a more advanced game play tip for the mirror match but knowing it and executing it correctly will win you matches. 
The turn player always has card and effect activation priority. This means that in your turn, you will always have to activate backrow and gladiator beast effects first. However, you can “pass” turn priority to your opponent by entering or exiting a phase with toggle set to off. You can also pass priority when attacking but attacking with toggle off is a very very risky play and I wouldn’t recommend even if you are a god at using the tap option.
The turn player also gets to decide the order effects go onto a chain (not relevant for GB) and the order in which continuous effects occur. Unfortunately, the duel links apps does chain order and continuous effects order automatically but it will always try and favour the turn player. The most common interaction you will see is that Super rush headlong will always activate for the turn player first regardless of the order in which it is played. You will also see this interaction occur with Sea Stealth Attack as it gains popularity.
When to turn toggle to “Off” during your turn
•	If you have attacked an enemy gladiator beast which is protected by impenetrable attack you can set toggle to off to pass turn priority to the opponent. They then have to tag out their gladiators first even on your turn. This allows you to bypass impenetrable attacks destruction effect since the new gladiator is not covered by it. You can then respond with your own Murmillo.
•	When to do this: A) Only if your opponent does not have enemy controller. B) Only when the impenetrable attacked gladiator is Murmillo when you only have one gladiator. C) Against any gladiator if you have two or more gladiators which battled this turn yourself. 
•	The above is true because: A) Your opponent could use enemy controller with priority in your turn. B) Murmillo cannot tag into Murmillo and therefore cannot destroy your gladiator C) your opponent can tag into Murmillo to destroy one of your gladiators, but you can then tag your own Murmillo into destroy their Murmillo.
•	IMPORTANT: After passing priority set toggle to ON or AUTO so that you can regain priority in order to activate your own gladiator and backrow card effects!
•	If your opponent has two gladiators, you can toggle to off to let them tag one out and then toggle to on to regain priority.

Some interesting notes regarding toggle:
If both players have toggle to off a yes/no screen will occur asking if you wish to tag out. This will occur in reverse summon order. If you press no here then you won’t have another chance to tag out. Therefore, if both players toggle to off the turn player MUST tag out first. Special thanks to Puzoor for helping me test this interaction.

Mirror match closing remarks
By learning and playtesting the mirror match you will gain a deep understanding of how the deck functions and will improve your general gameplay for all other matchups. For example, to do well in the mirror match you must learn how to use the toggle and how to make reads based on toggle delays which is a useful skill for any matchup you face (and any other deck you use!). You will have also learnt how to side deck well against one particular matchup which will allow you to side against other matchups more effectively.
I enjoy the mirror match and I am happy to playtest the mirror with you. Just send me a message on discord @brenduke#0011 to arrange a time that is convenient for us both.

5.1 Aliens
Dominant skills used: Balance, Restart, Mind scan

Gladiator beasts are the one deck in the metagame which is best equipped to deal with Aliens. This is because we can “tag-out” which removes a-counters from our monsters which can stop the alien deck from functioning. Additionally, our diverse suite of backrow options means that it is often the alien player who has to go on the offensive since we can very easily set our gladiators and force them to attack into cards like impenetrable attack or wall of disruption. Remember that the alien deck cannot put a-counters onto face down cards. You will want to play this matchup passively, but if you do not draw good backrow options you can also go on the offensive and start draining away their resources. If going aggressive make sure that you have an out to brainwashing beam and a way to deal with alien telepath. 
Matchup tips:
•	The effect of Alien monsters which states, "If a monster with an A-Counter battles an "Alien" monster, it loses 300 ATK and DEF for each A-Counter during damage calculation only", is applied by every face up Alien monster on the field which has this effect.This means that this effect stacks.  Therefore, if your Liqauri has 2 A-counter on it and it is attacked by a lone alien telepath it will lose 600 attack and defence. But if your opponent had a telepath and a warrior liquari would lose 1200 attack and so on. Remember this when attacking into Alien monsters.
•	Ideally, you will want to save floodgate trap hole for alien telepath.
•	Ideally, you will want to use cosmic cyclone on brainwashing beam or powerful rebirth. But, banishing A-cell is an option to stop them searching a monster if they have no cards in hand.
•	Don’t be afraid to stall out brainwashing beam until you get your monster back. They usually won’t attack your monsters with your gladiator out of fear of you taking it back with enemy controller. 
•	Like you would vs REZ, always bestiari backrow first in case you hit powerful rebirth, then murmillo after to kill the rebirthed monster. 
•	Always try to tag counters away if possible, Aliens crumble without A-counters on the board.
•	Play the matchup passively. Force them into attacking into wall of disruption or impenetrable attack.
•	You can bait out a big WoD play late game to set all their monsters to 0 attack and deck them out. If doing this remember they usually run 3x enemy controller and 1-2 alien overlord so they do have outs to a locked field. Remember, they cannot summon an overlord if there is already an overlord on their field.
•	Super rush headlong can destroy aliens before the damage step and acts as a form of removal. Only use defensively if toggles suggest that they have enemy controller. Super rush headlong is not regularly used by aliens so can be safely used in their turn.

Key cards: Cosmic cyclone, Floodgate trap hole, impenetrable attack, wall of disruption. 
Side deck options: Four-starred ladybug of doom, disappear, cosmic cyclone, remove brainwashing.
Matchup odds: Gladiator Favoured

5.2 Red eyes zombie dragon
Dominant skills used: straight to the grave, beatdown, tie that binds.

The REZD match up is one of the more interesting match-ups in the fact that you tend to make your plays differently based on the skill your opponent has. When playing vs Straight to the grave REZ, this match can sometimes be an uphill battle, simply because your opponents monsters are bigger than yours are. You want to make sure to hold onto Curse of Anubis until they make their storm play, to properly counter on your turn. If on the other hand, you are playing vs, the ties that bind, or beatdown REZ, If you are running Sphere kuriboh, you want to hold it in your hand for the Anti-Magic Arrow plays. To best take advantage of REZ, you want to force your opponent into a position where they are forced to pop their backrow. Simply sitting on your glads and waiting is not an optimal strategy, by forcing them to play their backrow, they have less cards to be able to get off a storm play with. So you want to go as aggressive as your hand will allow, and trade card for card. While it is now going out of favor, WOD destroys this deck hard. If you manage to get a WOD off vs REZ, you are in a much better position to be able to go on the offensive, as typically the most defensive card that REZ runs is either mirror wall or enemy controller, both cards of which are very good to force your opponent to play.

Match Up Tips:

•	When playing vs STTG REZD, you want to hold onto your curse of anubis if you have it. Using it to counteract the storm play, can put you in a powerful position if your opponent does not have much follow-up after the storm. 
•	Sphere Kuriboh is great for this match-up, however the trickiest part is you cannot use it with balance efficiently. If running Restart or Mind Scan, it is much easier to put it in the deck without messing with the ratios.
•	If you have a situation where you can tag out 2 glads in one turn, summon bestiari first to take out backrow, then tag into murmillo for the monster pop, if facing a REZD on the field, just in case of a face down spirit.
•	Play conservatively with your spells and traps whenever possible, try to only set 1-2 spells and traps at a time. this helps raise the potential cost of storm, and gives you resources for the following turns, after the storm play.
•	If running floodgate in your deck, preferably use it on gozuki or samurai skull. They are the easiest targets, and typically make the best targets to trigger your tags.

Key Cards: Curse of Anubis, Sphere Kuriboh, Windstorm of Etaqua, Wall of Disruption
Side Deck Options: Disappear, foolish return, Security Orb, Wild Tornado
Match up odds: Beatdown/TTTB, Gladiator’s Favored, Straight to the Grave, REZD Favored.


5.3 Gaia Plate Magnets
Dominant Skills: Straight to the grave, restart.

This deck has proven itself to be quite formidable and has gone from the metagames underdog to a true tier two deck. There are two main versions of the deck. Firstly a standard 20 card variant which is built for consistency and a 30 card grass version which gives up some consistency for power. The deck revolves around sending magnet warriors to the graveyard to provide fuel for Gaia plate and to enable delta’s ability to special summon valkyrion. The deck can also very easily swarm with powerful rebirths and carries outs to our backrow in anti-magic arrows (restart) or storm (SttG).  The 20 card version of the deck is easier to handle for us than the 30 card version because the 20 card version does not often carry Triamid pulse. We have an even matchup against this deck because we carry outs to both their boss monsters in floodgate trap hole, super rush headlong, murmillo and e-con take. You will want to save floodgate trap hole for Beta, valkyrion and gaia plate. You will also want to play around allowing delta to summon valkyrion unless you have an answer to it. For example, you may wish to attack with a gladiator before running over delta with liquari to open up and threaten the murmillo play. Also, you may wish to avoid destroying delta by battle if you have floodgate trap hole set. Here a murmillo on delta would be better than running over it in battle. I find that we have favourable odds against the restart version since liquari can beat over monsters but the SttG version stops us doing that. Additionally, storm is a bigger threat than Anti-magic arrows. 

Matchup tips:
•	If you destroy delta by battle you will not be able to respond to valkyrions summon with backrow unless it is spell speed 3 (counter trap).
•	Do not destroy delta while the opponent has enough magnets in grave to summon him if you do not have an answer to valkyrion
•	Do not waste backrow on Beta in your turn. Beta can tribute itself off as a quick effect. (e.g. do not floodgate it off rebirth/kurogane in your turn).
•	If tagging in two gladiators, always tag in bestiari first so that you can respond to powerful rebirth with murmillo
•	It is important to check your opponent’s graveyard in this matchup to see if a valkyrion summon is possible and to see how much rocks they have to maintain Gaia plate.
•	You should be trying to close this game out quickly. The longer this matchup goes on the worse it is for you. They will build up resources for a big storm/AMA OTK play.
•	The 20 card version of the deck does not have outs to nerokius outside of e-con take.
•	Since the deck has good swarm potential, getting off a big WoD is really good but bear in mind gaia plate can be tribute summoned.
•	You want to save cosmic cyclone for powerful rebirths and triamid pulse. You can also use it on the field spell to make liquari bigger than their deltas/alpha.
•	You will want to try and force their enemy controllers early. E-con take tributing delta is a common OTK play for them. This is why aggressive play is preferred.
•	Some builds tech a copy of snipe hunter and you will want to floodgate or memory loss this.
•	E-con take on valkyrion is a common play to end games.

Key cards:  Floodgate trap hole, murmillo, wall of disruption, nerokius
Side deck options: Four-starred ladybug of doom, crevice to the different dimension
Matchup odds: Restart: Gladiator favoured, SttG/grass:  Gladiators unfavourable.

5.4 Sea stealth attack Water
Dominant skills: Mythic Depths, Balance, Restart.

Sea stealth attack is potentially the strongest single card duel links has to offer and it is a very tough card for gladiator beasts to deal with. Decks like red eyes zombies can deal with the deck easily because they can OTK through it whereas gladiators cannot reliably do this. The deck functions in a similar manner to hazy flame decks in that they rely on three card combo to become a threat. This three card combo is very difficult to break. We cannot bestiari SSA itself or the field spell because it can protect itself from destruction, additionally, they can banish a monster targeted by murmillo to save it. If that wasn’t enough, the trap also allows water monsters whose original level was 5 or higher to destroy gladiators out of battle. Additionally, the deck runs abyss soldier as an out nerokius. This is a very difficult matchup for us, but with a few tech options in our main deck and side deck we actually stand a good chance of winning.

Matchup tips:
•	This is a popular ladder deck and therefore I recommend using two cosmic cyclone to deal with it. It is also popular in tournaments and therefore I recommend at least side decking two copies.
•	Always use cosmic cyclone on the field spell. When there is no field spell you can bestiari SSA. You will want to activate this in the endphase of your opponents turn or in your turn to prevent them activating another legendary ocean from hand. Do not use cosmic cyclone on anything other than the field spell.
•	Nerokius ignores sea stealth attack’s destruction effect and is bigger than any monster they run. However, you should ideally summon nerokius with floodgate trap hole support to stop abyss soldier/mecha sea dragon peilson.
•	Impenetrable attack stops SSA’s destruction effect and forces your opponent to banish their monster or allow you to tag in a monster.
•	Super rush headlong’s destruction effect occurs at an earlier stage in the battle phase than SSA and therefore always wins. This can force a banish from one monster which will cause a replay allowing you to destroy a second monster. Try and active headlong with a tagged in dimicari to threaten huge damage or the destruction of two monsters.
•	If SSA is active, your opponent can respond to cards such as floodgate trap hole, enemy controller and wall of disruption by banishing their monster until the end phase.
•	Citadel whale can only negate one targeting effect per turn so one option which requires a lot of set up is a double e-con play.
•	You win this matchup with an early cosmic cyclone or by been able to stall until you can summon nerokius. This is easier said than done.

Key cards: Cosmic cyclone, super rush headlong, impenetrable attack, dimacari, nerokius
Side deck options: Cosmic cyclone, DNA transplant, lava golem, closed forest.
Match-up odds: Unfavourable

5.5 Cyber Angels – Saffira 
Dominant skills used: Balance, Restart, Beatdown

Cyber Angels has a history with Gladiator Beasts. When Gladiators were first released, they had to deal with triple Dakini from the deck, and was a tough match up to get a foothold in without an econ. Since then, CA’s have been nerfed with the banlist, and now we have the introduction of CA-Saffira. For glads, this match is not too difficult if you have the appropriate backrow, which can be achieved with the skill balance. WIth the upcoming release of Hey, Trunade, this may be different story and glad’s may have to adjust themselves. As of right now however, this is how glads play. With either an econ or floodgate, there are alot of plays that gladiator beast can accomplish.  Typically with floodgate, you want to either floodgate, dakini or sapphira. by doing this, you shut down the recursion capability of CA’s tremendously. With Enemy controller, if Dakini triggers its effect, you can use enemy controller to steal the Dakini and send it to the grave. WOD is your third card that will help vs CA, as CA tends to spam multiple monsters on the field. This makes it much easier for your monsters to attack over they Cyber anger player’s monsters as well. Side note, this deck has a very hard time with 3SD Glads, because it cannot easily get over a set sanga unless they have not used dakini. Once dakini has been used, the deck struggles tremendously vs Sanga, unless they have a way to re-summon dakini.

Match-up Tips
•	With Balance, you have the easiest time getting to enemy controller or Floodgate. This style may change in the coming weeks, and this will be updated accordingly.  However, these are the 2 best cards to counter CA.
•	Using 3SD Glads, you pretty much autowin the match as long as you forced Dakini before summoning Sanga, or have another monster to pop with dakini’s effect.
•	Forcing their monsters into defence and attacking is typically the best play attack wise. You will need to tag into double murmillo to destroy their monsters due to their ritual protection.
•	With WOD, you can heavily have a match in your favour due to now being able to attack their monsters freely.

5.6 Golden Flying Fish
Dominant skills: Mythic depths, Mind scan, Balance.

This is a relatively new deck which is built around abusing golden flying fish and oyster meister to destroy two cards on the field. The deck uses powerful rebirth to use this combo multiple times in one turn and wipe the field. This deck can pose a threat because it can destroy multiple gladiators per turn outside of battle and clear backrow easily. As with any deck which focuses on a single unsearchable monster (outside of the one tuna) it has consistency issues. Gladiators are one of the best decks poised to deal with golden flying fish because we use floodgate trap hole which shuts the fish down allowing us to start draining their resources. This is a very polar matchup since you are heavily reliant on drawing floodgate trap hole before they can summon flying fish. If they summon flying fish and you don’t have a floodgate to respond to it you will have probably already lost. This is the biggest issue with going second vs the deck; if they go first and open fish, there isn’t much you are going to be able to do with your main deck.

Matchup tips:
•	Only floodgate trap hole golden flying fish
•	Using floodgate on hammer shark or oyster meister is a waste since flying fish can tribute face down fish type monsters.
•	When tagging in two gladiators always tag in bestiari first so that you can also murmillo the moster summoned by powerful rebirth.
•	If building to beat flying fish prioritise chainable backrow.
•	Save cosmic cyclone to respond to powerful rebirth to stop the fish being special summoned once more.
•	You need to play this matchup aggressively and try to close out the game before a rebirth + flying fish + oyster meister combo can occur.
•	If this deck gets popular you will need to side deck for it. 

Key cards: Floodgate trap hole, curse of Anubis, windstorm of equita, cosmic cyclone

5.7 Hazy flame Sphynx
Dominant skills: Aroma strategy, Beatdown

This has traditionally been one of our hardest matchups but the way we build gladiator beats decks now means we have lot of answers to the deck. The hazy flame deck runs a series of monsters which all cannot be targeted by card effects. This means we cannot murmillo their large monsters. The deck becomes difficult to deal with if they get beast rising. Fortunately, this trap is unsearchable and can be destroyed easily by bestiari or cosmic cyclone. The way to win this match is by putting their monsters in defence, a boosted liquari can beat over all havy monsters in defence position and does not care about boosted attack through beast rising. This can be achieved through cards such as floodgate trap hole, curse of Anubis, windstorm of equita, memory loss and sphere kuriboh. Unfortunately, enemy controller is useless in this particular matchup and should be sided out in a tournament. Super rush headlong also allows us to destroy hazy monsters regardless of beast rising. The biggest issue with hazy flame sphinx is the use of soul exchange. A newer variant of the deck uses beat down and fire first monsters. This is an inconsistent OTK deck that works on the ladder but has had no tournament success. They are very easy to deal with unless they get very lucky with goyukku targets using curse, windstorm or wall of disruption. Remember, you can’t bestiari their continuous spells if fire fist raven is face up on the field.
I classify this matchup as even and I know that is controversial. The reason being is that it is heavily dependent upon the backrow and sides you use and amount of soul exchange the hazy player uses. You can be favoured or unfavoured.

Match up tips:
•	Boosted Liquari beats over defence position hazy flame sphinx and unboosted attack position hazy flame sphinx.
•	Beast rising can banish a monster in response to wall of disruption, which means WoD is doing less attack reduction and more often than not will lead to a net attack increase.
•	Use enemy controller to defend your monster from flame tiger and caninetaur since these are useless against the decks tribute monsters.
•	Floodgate trap hole will set both monsters summoned as a result of hazy flame peryton
•	Vs the beatdown variant, bestiari cannot destroy goyukku or tensu if raven is face up on the field.
•	Dimicari + super rush headlong can clear two monsters in one turn.

Key cards: Super rush headlong, floodgate trap hole, cosmic cyclone, curse of anubis, windstorm of equita, wall of disruption, sphere kuriboh
Side deck options: Sphere kuriboh, Zombie world, lava golem, mirror wall, cosmic cyclone, xing zeng hu
Matchup Odds: Even matchup. 





5.8 Dinosaurs
Dominant skill: Dinosaur Kingdom
Modern dinosaur decks have given up the control route of using sergeant electro and transitioned to a backrow hate aggro deck. Because of this the deck either removes your backrow or pins it down with xing zeng hu or goyukku. If the dinosaur player opens really well or gets lucky with the goyukku/cosmic cyclone pops at your backrow it can be a tough matchup. Thankfully, this isn’t usually the case. The dinosaur deck burns through its own resources quickly and you can capitalise on that. I personally feel the backrow hate variant of the deck is easier to defeat than the control version due to a lack of good backrow. If you can survive their initial push and rebuild your backrow you can easily win. The match-up has got easier since we now main cosmic cyclone, allowing us to remove goyukku and xing without tagging in bestiari.
Matchup tips:
•	Use chainable backrow and attempt to put their monsters in defence position. Try and make a push to get a bestiary tag in on goyukku and xing zeng hu.
•	Use cosmic cyclone on goyukku or Xing. You can also use it when hydrogeddon declares an attack on liquari to banish the field spell which in turn puts hydrogeddon in killing range of liquari. This is a devastating move if pulled off.
•	You cannot chain to hydrogeddon’s effect unless you are using a spell speed 3 card (counter trap). DO not expect to be able to floodgate hydrogeddons effect.
•	You do not need to save floodgate for a specific monster unless you know they are running electro.
•	If you side four star ladybug of doom this becomes a very easy matchup.

Key cards: wall of disruption, Sphere kuriboh, curse of anubis, windstorm, floodgate trap hole, bestiari
Side deck options: four-starred ladybug of doom, Sphere kuriboh, cosmic cyclone, 
Match-up odds: Favourable

5.9 Snipe hunter volcanics
Dominant skills: Switcheroo, Bandit, Restart, sleight of hand
This is one of our toughest matchups because it has many ways of destroying our monsters outside of battle. The key to winning this matchup is to use floodgate trap hole on snipe hunter. Interestingly, the deck more often than not opts to not run enemy controller or any tribute monsters. I have found that the way to win this matchup is to lock up their field with floodgates and wall of disruption and go for a deck out victory. This is surprisingly easy to do but requires a lot of patience and you must not be tempted to attack floodgated monsters. Their only out to a locked up board is for them to snipe their own monsters. Obviously, you will need to clear snipe hunter if you did not manage to floodgate it to stop it from targeting backrow. The deck can very easily incorporate electro and if they do this matchup goes from bad to worse.
Matchup tips:
•	You win this matchup by locking down the monster cards zones through floodgate trap hole and wall of disruption. Of course, your chance of victory is heavily dependent on drawing those cards early.
•	Always try to clear face up snipe hunters and sergeant electro. Do not remove floodgated monsters unless you are well ahead on card advantage and you may win without the lock down (e.g. you have banished accelerator).
•	Be very patient.
•	Save cosmic cyclone to banish blaze accelerator. Most builds only use one, this makes the matchup much easier.
•	Do not get disheartened if you lose to this deck. It is almost always piloted by a top player and not many players have access to the deck because it is expensive.
Key cards: Floodgate trap hole, wall of disruption, cosmic cyclone
Side deck options: Forbidden chalice, mechizure, my body as a shield, four star ladybug of doom.
Matchup odds: Unfavourable.

6.0 Conclusion
If you have read this guide you will now have an excellent understanding as to how to play gladiator beasts and you should be able to now develop your own builds, tech choices and playstyle. 
Gladiator beasts are one of the most versatile decks in the metagame due to our small 7-8 card core which allows us to continuously rebuild our decks to adapt to anything Konami will throw at us for the foreseeable future. Gladiator beasts also have excellent future potential because any new generic spell or trap release can be used and there are many more gladiator beast monsters yet to be released. 

At some point our deck will get powercrept, but when that time comes we will remain a formidable rouge deck because we can very easily transition into an anti-meta deck.
We have amazing potential and the future looks brighter with the upcoming box, rampage of the forest, despite the general consensus that gladiators are a dead deck due to trunade.
