### Introduction & History
 
Spellbooks is an archetype that was released on May 1st in the Mini Box - [Visions of Ice] (/box-reviews/visions-of-ice/). The deck is a combo-oriented control based deck that revolves around using {Spellbook of Fate} to disrupt your opponent’s plays each turn and minimizing their resources. The metagame is currently heavily populated by Sylvans. This deck has the advantage of having an excellent Sylvan matchup thanks to the ability of {Spellbook of Fate} enabling you to banish your opponent’s cards each turn. This helps prevent {Sylvan Komushroomo} from causing problems when flipped.

#### About the Author
 
Hi there, I’m [Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/), a competitive Canadian Duel Links player and currently a member of the Top Player Council at Duel Links Meta. I test pretty much every deck to find out their strengths and weaknesses as well as how to best build each deck for different formats. My favourite decks of all time are [REZD](/tier-list/deck-types/red-eyes-zombies/) and [Hazy](/tier-list/deck-types/hazy-flame/). Although this deck is very powerful against current meta decks, I have noticed many players are not playing Spellbooks possibly due to the high skill cap of the deck and complicated combos. This deck falls under a similar category as Ninjas during the Nov 2017 KC Cup, as a powerful deck with many different options and combo paths depending on opening hands and your opponent’s set up. As this is also a difficult deck to play well, it has turned away many players, who would like to just pick the deck up and give it a try. Hopefully, you will be able to take away some useful tips about how to play this deck and against it. The combos in this deck are a bit difficult to master especially when being rushed by the timer, but I hope this guide will help you learn to execute them perfectly. This guide was written with some help from [Negative1](/authors/negative1/) for the template + [Jonesy9027](/authors/jonesy9027/) for helping me a bunch along the way to bring this guide to the website and help people who are curious about the deck learn how it works. I hope you all find it helpful! :D

### Decklist Breakdown
 
#### Grit Spellbooks vs Grass Spellbooks  
**30 Grass Books (Grass Books) with {Restart} vs 20-24 card Grit Spellbooks (Grit Books) with {Grit}**  
Many people are curious as to which version of the deck is better. Both versions have their advantages and disadvantages. 

Generally, Grass Books will be better on the ranked ladder or in the KC Cup due to the raw power that an activation of {That Grass Looks Greener} can give you. This loads up your grave with resources and gives you a huge advantage over your opponent. 

Grass Spellbooks run 30 cards and {Restart} which gives around a 62.07% chance going first with 4 cards and a 67.24% to draw it going second in 5 cards.

Grit Spellbooks have the advantage to be able to utilize their side deck better, as the lower card count will give a higher probability of drawing into side deck cards, during a match in games 2 and 3.
 
Grit Spellbooks are also able to potentially survive a One Turn Kill thanks to their skill. This greatly improves their matchup against [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/). However, not running Restart may also increase the chances of bricking with an unplayable hand.

**Conclusion:**  The 30 card Grass Variant is better as long as you are able to resolve grass and load up your grave with resources. The extra books in grave allow you to set up plays with Fate and resolve the Fool combo.

#### Monster Cards
**Note**: The monsters we use, and optimal counts will vary significantly based on the current meta. The current guide was written for May 2018. We will go in depth on how to use these cards in combo sections. 
 
[deck](Spellbook Magician of Prophecy;Fool of Prophecy;Reaper of Prophecy;Prophecy Destroyer)
 
* **{Spellbook Magician of Prophecy}** [Optimal Count: 3]   
Spellbook Magician of Prophecy aka **Blue Boi** allows you to search your deck for any Spellbook card except himself when normal summoned or flipped face up. This is one of the key pieces of the deck which allows you to start up your combos as he greatly increases the consistency of the deck and is a spellcaster type monster which is necessary to activate both {Spellbook of the Master} and {Spellbook of Fate}.  
 
* **{Fool of Prophecy}** [Optimal Count: 3]  
Fool of Prophecy is another powerful spellcaster that you will want in your opening hand if you do not have Blue Boi already. Instead of being able to search for any Spellbook, he is able to send any Spellbook spell card to the grave once per turn. This helps you fulfil the activation requirements of Fate and also helps if you open with Master instead of Secrets by sending Secrets to the grave to search for a card if necessary. Fool is also able to set up one of the deck’s most powerful combos, by special summoning {Reaper of Prophecy} from the deck during the End Phase if you have 5 or more Spellbook spell cards with different names in the grave. If possible, you will generally want to dump unused books e.g. Spellbook of Crescent, so you don’t draw them later on in the game. Remember that Fool’s End Phase effect can only be activated if you activate his effect to send a book to the grave during the main phase of that turn. So even if your grass mills 5 different books, make sure to send an extra book using Fool’s effect, so you can summon a level 5 or higher spellcaster from the deck.  

* **{Reaper of Prophecy}** [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
Reaper of Prophecy is a power level 6 spellcaster with 3 effects dependent on how many Spellbook spells with different names are in grave. It gains its most useful effects it is summoned with at least 4 different books in grave which gives you a free search from the deck for a Spellbook. When it is summoned with at least 5 different books in grave it allows you to special summon an additional level 5 or higher spellcaster from the deck. This nets you a huge increase in card advantage as you will generally be summoning Reaper off of Fool which allows you to fully utilize all 3 effects. Other than being able to be summoned off of Fool, you can also tribute summon it or revive it from the grave with {Spellbook of Life}.  **Note:** Reaper of Prophecy’s effect is solely determined by the current number of book in grave when it’s effect resolves, therefore its effect will still resolve even if Reaper is removed from the field.  
 
* **{Prophecy Destroyer}** [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
Prophecy Destroyer is what you will usually be summoning off of Reaper. Prophecy Destroyer and Reaper can be run in combination, such that they take up to a total of 3 slots in the deck. Some players prefer to run 2 Prophecy Destroyer due to its power effect of being able to revive itself by banishing 3 books from grave. This is especially useful if you mill it with grass as it puts extra damage on the board and allows you to beat over opponent’s monsters with a huge 2500 atk monster. However, Reaper is better, should you draw it, as it has a more useful effect on field. By playing 2 Reaper, you have a much higher chance of resolving Fool combo even if you draw an extra Reaper in your opening hand.  

#### Spell Cards  
**Note**: The spells we use, and optimal counts will vary significantly based on the current meta. The current guide was written for May 2018. We will go in depth on how to use these cards in the combo sections.  
 
[deck](Spellbook of Secrets;Spellbook of the Master;Spellbook of Fate;That Grass Looks Greener;Spellbook of Eternity;Spellbook of Power;Spellbook Library of the Crescent;Spellbook of Life)
 
* **{Spellbook of Secrets}** [Optimal Count: 3]  
Secrets is the core spell of Spellbooks and is what propels them into the top tier of the current meta. This card acts as the best searcher in the deck which allows you to easily access any of your other books.  
 
* **{Spellbook of the Master}** [Optimal Count: 2-3]   
Master is able to copy any Spellbook normal spell in the grave by revealing another book in your hand. Master is most commonly used to copy Secrets for an additional search which helps you set up your Fate combo. **Note:** Ideally you want to reveal cards that you have already searched to give your opponent less knowledge about your hand which helps with bluffing when setting cards.  

* **{Spellbook of Fate}** [Optimal Count: 3]   
Spellbooks are built to completely revolve around this one card as it is currently one of the most powerful cards in the game. It is a ridiculously powerful quick play spell that can be activated on either player’s turn to disrupt and remove threats from your opponent. By banishing 3 books from grave, you can **BANISH** any of your opponent’s cards **AND** it doesn’t target which allows you to choose the card to banish as the chain resolves. By banishing 2 books from grave, you can flip a monster on either player’s field facedown. This is mostly useful to flip down a Blue Boi to protect yourself from damage or to dodge {Offerings to the Doomed} or {Last Day of Witch}. Blue Boi has the added benefit of being able to search an additional book after being flipped up for even more advantage. Fate also has an effect which allows you to bounce any set spell or trap on the field to the hand by banishing 1 book from the grave. This effect is least used as you would generally only use this effect to set up Fool combo or bounce 1 of your opponent’s backrow to hand during their End Phase.  

* **{That Grass Looks Greener}** [Optimal Count: 3]  
This is one of the power cards of the deck which sends cards from your deck to the grave, so that you have the same number of cards as your opponent. Most other meta decks run 20 cards, so you usually will be able to send 10 cards to the grave to fuel the rest of your combos.  

* **{Spellbook of Eternity}** [Optimal Count: 2-3]  
This Spellbook allows you to recover any of your banished spellbooks. This card is particularly useful for adding back Fate or Secrets to set up your plays.  

* **{Spellbook of Power}** [Optimal Count: 1]  
This Spellbook gives any of your spellcasters a **1000 atk boost** for the rest of the turn and can search for another book in deck if the boosted monster destroys an opponent’s monster by battle. Commonly this card is used turn 1 if you require 1 more book in grave to set up the effect of Fate.  

* **{Spellbook Library of the Crescent}** [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
Crescent is one of the starter cards you would like to see in your opening hand if you already have Secrets. This spellbook can only be activated while you have no spellbooks in grave, so you must activate this one before activating any of your other books. Crescent allows you to randomly add 1 of 3 chosen spellbooks to your hand, which has a bit of risk. However, this book makes a great starter as it is great for easily enabling plays on the first turn like the Fool and Fate combo. An important note is that after activating Crescent, you will not be able to activate non-Spellbook spell cards like Grass.  

* **{Spellbook of Life}** [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
Life is an equip spell that is able to revive any targeted spellcaster from your grave. You must banish another spellcaster from grave and reveal another Spellbook in hand to activate its effect. You usually will want to revive Reaper or Fool after a successful Grass mill, to generate advantage and pump out strong monsters onto your field.  

#### Trap Cards  
**Note**: The traps we use, and optimal counts will vary significantly based on the current meta. The current guide was written for May 2018. We will go in depth on how to use these cards in the combo sections.  

[deck](Treacherous Trap Hole)

* **{Treacherous Trap Hole}** [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
Treacherous is the most powerful trap card in deck that run few trap cards. It has no cost and is capable of destroying up to 2 of your opponent’s monsters. The downside to this card is that is must destroy exactly 2 monsters, so if your opponent only has 1 monster, it is not as effective. 2 should really only be played in variants without Grass as Grass makes milling this trap a liability for potential dead draws later in the game.  

#### Tech and Side Deck Cards  
**Note**: The tech and side cards we use, and optimal counts will vary significantly based on the current meta. The current guide was written for May 2018. We will go in depth on how to use these cards in the combo sections. 

[deck](Spellbook Organization; Monster Gate; The Tricky; Cosmic Cyclone; Offerings to the Doomed; Warrior Elimination; Last Day of Witch)

* Spellbook Organization replaces the need to search for Spellbook of Power on the first turn in order to enable the Fate 3 combo on the following turn. The main advantage Organization has over Power is that it has the benefit of being able to reorganize the top 3 cards of your deck, so that you can draw the card of your choice on the next turn. You are also able to set Organization as a bluff on your opponent’s turn, which minimizes the risk of your Fate being hit by an opponent’s card. By activating Organization first, then activating Fate to banish as soon as Organization finishes resolving, will allow you to optimally disrupt your opponent’s plays. This additional benefit is great for players that are looking to play it as a tech card.  

* Monster Gate is a card that is similar to Grass in the sense that it allows you to send additional books from your deck to the grave. Normally, you will want to activate it by tributing a Blue Boi and hope to mill spellbooks from your deck as well as summon either a Fool or Reaper from your deck. It is a great card but is a bit reliant on luck to mill the right cards and to not summon another Blue Boi from deck.   

* The Tricky is a very nice tech card for spellbook mirror matches as it allows you to summon an additional spellcaster monster onto the field to take advantage of Fate’s effect as well as deal some nice damage to your opponent with its 2000 atk. Its summoning condition of discarding a hard from your hand can also help dump an extra book to the grave turn 1 to enable Fate combo or to get rid of unusable cards later in the game.  

* Cosmic Cyclone is another nice tech card to have vs the spellbook mirror or vs backrow heavy decks like Amazoness. By paying 1000 LP, Cyclone allows you to bait out an opponent’s Fate in the mirror and can help remove pesky backrow in other matchups. Zombie World and DNA Surgery are becoming increasingly popular to be sided against spellbooks to change their typing. Cyclone is a great card to help remove these threats.  

* Offerings to the Doomed serves a similar function as Cosmic Cyclone to instead remove monster threats. Similarly, to Cosmic Cyclone, it can be activated on your opponent’s turn to disrupt their plays. Offerings comes at the cost of skipping your next draw phase, but by activating multiple offerings within the same turn, only 1 draw phase is skipped.  

* Warrior Elimination/Last Day of Witch are both side deck techs that are very effective against warrior and spellcaster monsters respectively. These cards serve as a {Dark Hole} to your opponent and helps get rid of troublesome monsters. These cards should only be run in the side deck to improve certain matchups when necessary.
