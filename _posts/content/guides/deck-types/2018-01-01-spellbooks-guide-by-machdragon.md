### Introduction & History
 
Spellbooks is an archetype that was released on May 1st in the Mini Box - [Visions of Ice] (/box-reviews/visions-of-ice/). The deck is a combo-oriented control based deck that revolves around using {Spellbook of Fate} to disrupt your opponent’s plays each turn and minimizing their resources. The metagame is currently heavily populated by Sylvans. This deck has the advantage of having an excellent Sylvan matchup thanks to the ability of {Spellbook of Fate} enabling you to banish your opponent’s cards each turn. This helps prevent {Sylvan Komushroomo} from causing problems when flipped.

#### About the Author
 
Hi there, I’m [Machdragon](/top-player-council/machdragon/), a competitive Canadian Duel Links player and currently a member of the Top Player Council at Duel Links Meta. I test pretty much every deck to find out their strengths and weaknesses as well as how to best build each deck for different formats. My favourite decks of all time are [REZD](/tier-list/deck-types/red-eyes-zombies/) and [Hazy](/tier-list/deck-types/hazy-flame/). Although this deck is very powerful against current meta decks, I have noticed many players are not playing Spellbooks possibly due to the high skill cap of the deck and complicated combos. This deck falls under a similar category as Ninjas during the Nov 2017 KC Cup, as a powerful deck with many different options and combo paths depending on opening hands and your opponent’s set up. As this is also a difficult deck to play well, it has turned away many players, who would like to just pick the deck up and give it a try. Hopefully, you will be able to take away some useful tips about how to play this deck and against it. The combos in this deck are a bit difficult to master especially when being rushed by the timer, but I hope this guide will help you learn to execute them perfectly. This guide was written with some help from [Negative1](/authors/negative1/) for the template + [Jonesy9027](/authors/jonesy9027/) for helping me a bunch along the way to bring this guide to the website and help people who are curious about the deck learn how it works. I hope you all find it helpful! :D

### Decklist Breakdown
 
#### Grit Spellbooks vs Grass Spellbooks  
**30 Grass Books (Grass Books) with {Restart} vs 20-24 card Grit Spellbooks (Grit Books) with {Grit}**  
Many people are curious as to which version of the deck is better. Both versions have their advantages and disadvantages. 

Generally, Grass Books will be better on the ranked ladder or in the KC Cup due to the raw power that an activation of {That Grass Looks Greener} can give you. This loads up your grave with resources and gives you a huge advantage over your opponent. 

Grass Spellbooks run 30 cards and {Restart} which gives around a 62.07% chance going first with 4 cards and a 67.24% to draw it going second in 5 cards.

Grit Spellbooks have the advantage to be able to utilize their side deck better, as the lower card count will give a higher probability of drawing into side deck cards, during a match in games 2 and 3.
 
Grit Spellbooks are also able to potentially survive a One Turn Kill thanks to their skill. This greatly improves their matchup against [Masked Heroes](/tier-list/deck-types/masked-heroes/). However, not running Restart may also increase the chances of bricking with an unplayable hand.

**Conclusion:**  The 30 card Grass Variant is better as long as you are able to resolve grass and load up your grave with resources. The extra books in grave allow you to set up plays with Fate and resolve the Fool combo.

#### Monster Cards
**Note**: The monsters we use, and optimal counts will vary significantly based on the current meta. The current guide was written for May 2018. We will go in depth on how to use these cards in combo sections. 
 
[deck](Spellbook Magician of Prophecy;Fool of Prophecy;Reaper of Prophecy;Prophecy Destroyer)
 
* **{Spellbook Magician of Prophecy}** [Optimal Count: 3]   
Spellbook Magician of Prophecy aka **Blue Boi** allows you to search your deck for any Spellbook card except himself when normal summoned or flipped face up. This is one of the key pieces of the deck which allows you to start up your combos as he greatly increases the consistency of the deck and is a spellcaster type monster which is necessary to activate both {Spellbook of the Master} and {Spellbook of Fate}.  
 
* **{Fool of Prophecy}** [Optimal Count: 3]  
Fool of Prophecy is another powerful spellcaster that you will want in your opening hand if you do not have Blue Boi already. Instead of being able to search for any Spellbook, he is able to send any Spellbook spell card to the grave once per turn. This helps you fulfil the activation requirements of Fate and also helps if you open with Master instead of Secrets by sending Secrets to the grave to search for a card if necessary. Fool is also able to set up one of the deck’s most powerful combos, by special summoning {Reaper of Prophecy} from the deck during the End Phase if you have 5 or more Spellbook spell cards with different names in the grave. If possible, you will generally want to dump unused books e.g. Spellbook of Crescent, so you don’t draw them later on in the game. Remember that Fool’s End Phase effect can only be activated if you activate his effect to send a book to the grave during the main phase of that turn. So even if your grass mills 5 different books, make sure to send an extra book using Fool’s effect, so you can summon a level 5 or higher spellcaster from the deck.  

* **{Reaper of Prophecy}** [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
Reaper of Prophecy is a powerful level 6 spellcaster with 3 effects dependent on how many Spellbook spells with different names are in grave. It gains its most useful effects it is summoned with at least 4 different books in grave which gives you a free search from the deck for a Spellbook. When it is summoned with at least 5 different books in grave it allows you to special summon an additional level 5 or higher spellcaster from the deck. This nets you a huge increase in card advantage as you will generally be summoning Reaper off of Fool which allows you to fully utilize all 3 effects. Other than being able to be summoned off of Fool, you can also tribute summon it or revive it from the grave with {Spellbook of Life}.  **Note:** Reaper of Prophecy’s effect is solely determined by the current number of books in grave when it’s effect resolves, therefore its effect will still resolve even if Reaper is removed from the field.  
 
* **{Prophecy Destroyer}** [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
Prophecy Destroyer is what you will usually be summoning off of Reaper. Prophecy Destroyer and Reaper can be run in combination, such that they take up to a total of 3 slots in the deck. Some players prefer to run 2 Prophecy Destroyer due to its powerful effect of being able to revive itself by banishing 3 books from grave. This is especially useful if you mill it with grass as it puts extra damage on the board and allows you to beat over opponent’s monsters with a huge 2500 atk monster. However, Reaper is better, should you draw it, as it has a more useful effect on field. By playing 2 Reaper, you have a much higher chance of resolving Fool combo even if you draw an extra Reaper in your opening hand.  

#### Spell Cards  
**Note**: The spells we use, and optimal counts will vary significantly based on the current meta. The current guide was written for May 2018. We will go in depth on how to use these cards in the combo sections.  
 
[deck](Spellbook of Secrets;Spellbook of the Master;Spellbook of Fate;That Grass Looks Greener;Spellbook of Eternity;Spellbook of Power;Spellbook Library of the Crescent;Spellbook of Life)
 
* **{Spellbook of Secrets}** [Optimal Count: 3]  
Secrets is the core spell of Spellbooks and is what propels them into the top tier of the current meta. This card acts as the best searcher in the deck which allows you to easily access any of your other books.  
 
* **{Spellbook of the Master}** [Optimal Count: 2-3]   
Master is able to copy any Spellbook normal spell in the grave by revealing another book in your hand. Master is most commonly used to copy Secrets for an additional search which helps you set up your Fate combo. **Note:** Ideally you want to reveal cards that you have already searched to give your opponent less knowledge about your hand which helps with bluffing when setting cards.  

* **{Spellbook of Fate}** [Optimal Count: 3]   
Spellbooks are built to completely revolve around this one card as it is currently one of the most powerful cards in the game. It is a ridiculously powerful quick play spell that can be activated on either player’s turn to disrupt and remove threats from your opponent. By banishing 3 books from grave, you can **BANISH** any of your opponent’s cards **AND** it doesn’t target which allows you to choose the card to banish as the chain resolves. By banishing 2 books from grave, you can flip a monster on either player’s field facedown. This is mostly useful to flip down a Blue Boi to protect yourself from damage or to dodge {Offerings to the Doomed} or {Last Day of Witch}. Blue Boi has the added benefit of being able to search an additional book after being flipped up for even more advantage. Fate also has an effect which allows you to bounce any set spell or trap on the field to the hand by banishing 1 book from the grave. This effect is least used as you would generally only use this effect to set up Fool combo or bounce 1 of your opponent’s backrow to hand during their End Phase.  

* **{That Grass Looks Greener}** [Optimal Count: 3]  
This is one of the power cards of the deck which sends cards from your deck to the grave, so that you have the same number of cards as your opponent. Most other meta decks run 20 cards, so you usually will be able to send 10 cards to the grave to fuel the rest of your combos.  

* **{Spellbook of Eternity}** [Optimal Count: 2-3]  
This Spellbook allows you to recover any of your banished spellbooks. This card is particularly useful for adding back Fate or Secrets to set up your plays.  

* **{Spellbook of Power}** [Optimal Count: 1]  
This Spellbook gives any of your spellcasters a **1000 atk boost** for the rest of the turn and can search for another book in deck if the boosted monster destroys an opponent’s monster by battle. Commonly this card is used turn 1 if you require 1 more book in grave to set up the effect of Fate.  

* **{Spellbook Library of the Crescent}** [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
Crescent is one of the starter cards you would like to see in your opening hand if you already have Secrets. This spellbook can only be activated while you have no spellbooks in grave, so you must activate this one before activating any of your other books. Crescent allows you to randomly add 1 of 3 chosen spellbooks to your hand, which has a bit of risk. However, this book makes a great starter as it is great for easily enabling plays on the first turn like the Fool and Fate combo. An important note is that after activating Crescent, you will not be able to activate non-Spellbook spell cards like Grass.  

* **{Spellbook of Life}** [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
Life is an equip spell that is able to revive any targeted spellcaster from your grave. You must banish another spellcaster from grave and reveal another Spellbook in hand to activate its effect. You usually will want to revive Reaper or Fool after a successful Grass mill, to generate advantage and pump out strong monsters onto your field.  

#### Trap Cards  
**Note**: The traps we use, and optimal counts will vary significantly based on the current meta. The current guide was written for May 2018. We will go in depth on how to use these cards in the combo sections.  

[deck](Treacherous Trap Hole)

* **{Treacherous Trap Hole}** [Optimal Count: 1-2]  
Treacherous is the most powerful trap card in decks that run few trap cards. It has no cost and is capable of destroying up to 2 of your opponent’s monsters. The downside to this card is that is must destroy exactly 2 monsters, so if your opponent only has 1 monster, it is not as effective. 2 should really only be played in variants without Grass as Grass makes milling this trap a liability for potential dead draws later in the game.  

#### Tech and Side Deck Cards  
**Note**: The tech and side cards we use, and optimal counts will vary significantly based on the current meta. The current guide was written for May 2018. We will go in depth on how to use these cards in the combo sections. 

[deck](Spellbook Organization; Monster Gate; The Tricky; Cosmic Cyclone; Offerings to the Doomed; Warrior Elimination; Last Day of Witch)

* Spellbook Organization replaces the need to search for Spellbook of Power on the first turn in order to enable the Fate 3 combo on the following turn. The main advantage Organization has over Power is that it has the benefit of being able to reorganize the top 3 cards of your deck, so that you can draw the card of your choice on the next turn. You are also able to set Organization as a bluff on your opponent’s turn, which minimizes the risk of your Fate being hit by an opponent’s card. By activating Organization first, then activating Fate to banish as soon as Organization finishes resolving, will allow you to optimally disrupt your opponent’s plays. This additional benefit is great for players that are looking to play it as a tech card.  

* Monster Gate is a card that is similar to Grass in the sense that it allows you to send additional books from your deck to the grave. Normally, you will want to activate it by tributing a Blue Boi and hope to mill spellbooks from your deck as well as summon either a Fool or Reaper from your deck. It is a great card but is a bit reliant on luck to mill the right cards and to not summon another Blue Boi from deck.   

* The Tricky is a very nice tech card for spellbook mirror matches as it allows you to summon an additional spellcaster monster onto the field to take advantage of Fate’s effect as well as deal some nice damage to your opponent with its 2000 atk. Its summoning condition of discarding a card from your hand can also help dump an extra book to the grave turn 1 to enable Fate combo or to get rid of unusable cards later in the game.  

* Cosmic Cyclone is another nice tech card to have vs the spellbook mirror or vs backrow heavy decks like Amazoness. By paying 1000 LP, Cyclone allows you to bait out an opponent’s Fate in the mirror and can help remove pesky backrow in other matchups. Zombie World and DNA Surgery are becoming increasingly popular to be sided against spellbooks to change their typing. Cyclone is a great card to help remove these threats.  

* Offerings to the Doomed serves a similar function as Cosmic Cyclone to instead remove monster threats. Similarly, to Cosmic Cyclone, it can be activated on your opponent’s turn to disrupt their plays. Offerings comes at the cost of skipping your next draw phase, but by activating multiple offerings within the same turn, only 1 draw phase is skipped.  

* Warrior Elimination/Last Day of Witch are both side deck techs that are very effective against warrior and spellcaster monsters respectively. These cards serve as a {Dark Hole} to your opponent and helps get rid of troublesome monsters. These cards should only be run in the side deck to improve certain matchups when necessary.

### Matchup Guide
This covers the [tier list](/tier-list/) as defined by Duel Links Meta and the [Top Player Council](/top-player-council/). This section also includes decks that have fallen off of the tier list but you may still face from time to time.
 
#### Mirror Match 
Common Skills: {Restart}, {Grit}
- Matchup Odds: 
    * 50/50 Coin Flips Meta Believe in the Heart of the Cards!

The Spellbook mirror is highly dependent on the player that gets to start first. If the starting player is able to set up the Fate 3 combo, combined with a follow-up play like Secrets or Eternity for next turn, it is near impossible for your opponent to break your combo. 

**Matchup Tips** 
* By using fate to banish your opponent’s spellcaster when it is summoned, they will not be able to control the board. You are able to repeat this process each turn and can win the matchup just by attacking each turn with Blue Boi! If you go second, the way to win the mirror match is to set Treacherous Trap Hole along with another Spellbook to bluff. You will want to wait until your opponent summons their 2nd Blue Boi, and then activate Treacherous in the battle phase. This ensures that their Spellbook of Fate will be set and both of their Blue Bois will be destroyed as a result. On your next turn, you are now in control and can begin establishing board presence with your own Fate, while also begin chipping away at their life points.

* In the side deck, Cosmic Cyclone, Offerings to the Doomed and Last Day of Witch are your best cards to draw against the mirror match. Going second with any of these 3 side deck cards gives you the advantage to force out Fate early, so you can begin controlling the board with your own Fate. Last Day of Witch is particularly useful while your opponent has multiple monsters on the field after using Fool’s effect. If your opponent plays these cards against you, you will want to chain Fate to flip down your own spellcaster monster. Both Offerings and Last Day of Witch only affect face-up monsters on the field and flipping down a Blue Boi gives you an additional advantage of being able to search when your opponent attacks into it.

---

#### Masked Heroes
Common Skills: {Restart}
- Matchup Odds: 
    * 40/60 Heroes Assembled

This matchup is one of the more difficult matchups for Spellbooks. Masked Heroes enjoy running Cosmic Cyclone and Offerings to the Doomed in the main deck which can force out and early Fate. Another reason they are difficult to deal with is their ability to easily bring out 2 monsters against you on the first turn.

**Matchup Tips** 
* If your opponent enters the battle phase with 1 monster and has higher attack than your Spellbook monster, activate Fate to banish their monster. Fate does not target when choosing the card to banish, this means you are able to banish their {Masked Hero Anki} as the chain resolves, if they attempt to use {Mask Change}.

* If your opponent tries to use Cosmic Cyclone, Offerings or another card that threatens either your spellcaster on field or your set Spellbook of Fate, you will want to activate Fate to flip your Blue Boi facedown. This prevents you from taking damage from a huge {Vision Hero Trinity} attack, while also gaining a search when Blue Boi is flipped during battle.

* When your opponent summons Vyon, make sure to turn toggle on. This way you can wait until Vyon’s effect resolves to see what they send to the grave. If they send another Vyon to the grave, this means that they plan to use Vyon’s effect to banish the Hero in grave to search a Polymerization for a fusion summon. By activating Fate here to banish your opponent’s Vyon, you will be able to shut down their turn as they have already used their normal summon for the turn.

* Flipping your own Blue Boi face-down is also a good move if your opponent summons {Vision Hero Vyon} and uses the Malicious they send to summon another copy of Malicious from their deck. During their battle phase, they will attack using their 800 atk Malicious first. This way your Blue Boi will be removed from the field and you will not be able to use Fate while you do not control a spellcaster. When they attack with Malicious, this is when you want to flip Blue Boi face-down to prevent damage and gain a search. They usually will attack with Vyon next dealing 1000 damage and follow up with a Mask Change by summoning Anki for another 2800 damage. Here you have taken 1000+2800 = 3800, leaving you with 200 LP left. Only if your opponent is very lucky they will be able to draw either a Chalice or Mask Change to actually kill you that turn. If you had not protected yourself from the Malicious attack, you would have taken 300 extra damage and lost the game right there. You will want to remove Anki from the field as well as Malicious by using a combination of Spellbook of Fate and Power to clear your opponent’s monsters, while setting up another Fate to protect yourself and disrupt your opponent on the following turn.

* Some Hero players like to use {Destiny HERO – Drilldark} in their Hero builds. His effect special summons a Destiny Hero from hand with ATK less than or equal to Drilldark’s ATK on field. This means that by using Fate to flip down Drilldark or banish to it from the field, your opponent will not be able to summon an extra Destiny Hero from hand. Cool right?

---

#### Sylvans
Common Skills: {Grit}, {Restart}
- Matchup Odds: 
    * 80/20 Free Salads

Sylvans are one of the contributing factors as to why Spellbooks are currently the one of the best decks in the format. Spellbooks have a ridiculously good Sylvan matchup. Set a {Sylvan Komushroomo}? Fate. {Rose Lover}? Fate. {World Carrotweight Champion}? Fate. Being able to banish key pieces of the Sylvan combo give this deck an amazing matchup against them. 

**Matchup Tips**
* The most commonly played skill in Sylvans is Grit. This is usually not a relevant factor for Spellbooks as we chip away at their LP 500 at a time. However, there is still a chance for Grit to activate (LP at start of turn x 0.0002125), setting up a Fate just in case is a good idea.

* Sylvan Komushroomo’s effect to mill up to 5 cards activates When it is flipped face-up. This means Shroom’s effect must be Chain Link 1 in order for it to resolve properly. If any effect is activated first as Chain Link 1, and Shroom is flipped up by a card effect during Chain Link 2 or higher, Shroom’s will not activate because its effect will miss timing. This is great for us because we don’t need to banish 3 books to take out a Set Shroom. For example, if we suspect our opponent has set a Shroom against us and we have Fate 3 combo available, we can activate a Spellbook card e.g. Power and then chain Fate to Power as Chain Link 2. Shroom’s effect will not activate and we will be able to attack the face-up Shroom, dealing damage and searching our deck for another Spellbook.

---

#### Amazoness
Common Skills: {Restart}
- Matchup Odds: 
    * 45/55 Strong Independent Women

Amazoness has a decent matchup against Spellbooks. The key to this matchup is to control the number of Amazoness monsters your opponent is able to summon against you. Each turn, your opponent should be able to summon an Amazoness monster against you and each turn you will want to use Fate to banish your opponent’s monsters. Spellbooks are able consecutively Fate your opponent’s cards, usually around 4-5 times per duel. Once your opponent runs out of monsters to summon, they will have a very difficult time against Spellbooks as they are no longer able to protect their life points. If your opponent’s Amazoness deck runs Cosmic Cyclone or Offerings to the Doomed, they will have a better matchup against you. If you suspect your opponent is playing Cyclone, you can consider setting another book as a bluff. {Amazoness Sage} seems dangerous to set bluffs, but it is usually only ran at 1 copy, cannot be searched and will be special summoned in defense by {Amazoness Princess}.

**Matchup Tips**

* One of the few ways that Amazoness are able to beat Spellbooks is by getting an early onslaught as well as multiple monsters to summon each turn to try and swarm the field faster than Spellbooks can keep up with. Amazoness decks usually run 9-10 monsters, this means they need to open with a great hand and draw a monster each turn. To keep up with your Fate consecutively banishing their monsters. The winner of the match is usually decided if your opponent is still able to play their monsters after getting hit by Fate 4-5 times in a row.

* Once your opponent summons an Amazoness monster, turn toggle on. This is to check if your opponent has {Amazoness Baby Tiger} in hand as Baby Tiger must be summoned right after another Amazoness is summoned. Next, you will want to keep toggle on, so that you can use Fate the moment your opponent enters the battle phase. If your opponent had summoned a Princess, you want to use Fate and banish it now before they get a chance to attack. However, if your opponent only sets 1 card in their backrow and had searched Onslaught earlier in the turn, you can choose to get rid of the set card (probably Onslaught) instead. If going for this play, wait for your opponent to declare an attack with Princess, and after sending a card from their hand as cost to summon the monster from deck. On your next turn, you will be able to Fate away their summoned monster, most likely {Amazoness Queen} or Baby Tiger, and use Power to swing over their Princess, while also setting yourself up for plays next turn.

* I recommend banishing Baby Tiger or Princess if you have the resources to do so, as they are one of the few ways that your opponent will be able to bring out 2 monsters to threaten your field. An interesting note is that a Blue Boi boosted by Power ties in atk with {Amazoness Swords Woman} at 1500 atk. Even if both monsters are destroyed by battle, you will still get to search for a book due to the effect of Power. Power will also still get you the search even if your monster is banished by Onslaught. 

* Resolving Fool combo which summons Reaper and Destroyer gives you a huge power swing which helps you win this matchup. Onslaught is like poison to your Spellbooks as they will be banished after battling with your opponent’s Amazoness monsters. Normally, Blue Boi and Fool are not strong enough to defeat Amazoness monsters by battle. However, Reaper and Destroyer are able to chunk your opponent down quickly, since you can now banish the Onslaught with Fate and destroy the Amazoness monsters by battle. This is a much better alternative, instead of having to use Fate to banish each monster they summon per turn.

---

#### Aliens
Common Skills: {Restart}, {Balance}
- Matchup Odds: 
    * 40/60 On the Brink of Extinction

Aliens can be a difficult matchup, depending on your opponent’s opening hands. Their main way to beat Spellbooks is to invade the field with many monsters. They do this by using use {“A” Cell Recombination Device} combined with {Powerful Rebirth}. Blue Boi and Fool are both unable to destroy Aliens by battle, so you will need to either attack with a Power boost, Reaper or Destroyer. The main win condition of this matchup is similar to Amazoness. If your opponent is able to beam enough Aliens to the field, you will lose control of your line of defense and Earth will fall. 
Good thing this is a tier 3 deck, so it is not as common as the other meta decks listed.

**Matchup Tips**
* {Brainwashing Beam} is a dangerous card that is run by some Alien decks as they can abduct your spellcasters and this prevents you from using Fate if you don’t control any other spellcasters. However, you can chain Fate to flip your spellcaster face-down to prevent Brainwashing Beam from stealing your monster.
* You can use Fate to flip your own monsters face down to reset A-counters. If your opponent searches for {Alien Overlord} by banishing an “A” Cell Recombination Device in the grave, you want to turn toggle on when your opponent activates the effect to search. Once Overlord is added to your opponent’s hand, use Fate to flip your Blue Boi with A-counters face down. This prevents your opponent from summoning their Overlord and also prevents {Alien Telepath} from destroying your set cards.

* If you see an Alien, use Fate to kill it with extreme prejudice. Once you have repelled the Alien invasion, you can chunk them down with your spellcasters. :D

### Combos and Plays

#### Starter Card Stats
Here is an example of some of the statistics to draw your starter cards in your opening hand in 30 card books.  
I show the stats of opening your starter cards first without {Restart} and followed by the stats of opening with your starter cards after Restarting.  
You can see a notable increase in the consistency of the deck, which is why Restart is the best skill for the 30 card deck.  
The probability stats are calculated using hypergeometic distribution along with their respective standard deviations.  
Furthermore, you can see that there is a **15.17%** increase in consistency of opening with 3 Blue Boi instead of 2 (one of your key combo starters) when going first and a **15.52%** increase in consistency with 3 Blue Boi going second. Therfore, 3 Blue Boi is the standard in an optimal build of Spellbooks.  
This conclusion is also supported by the many other Spellbook players in the community such as Snyffus, Pawapoke, Looler and ExiledWalrus. All competent Spellbook topped or won premier, competitive Duel Links tournaments with 3 Blue Bois in the past month.

#### Combos
Below are some example combos and play options. It is important to remember that a good player does not simply memorize plays and only follow that play every game. You need to read every opponent and every game individually, there is not one simple play to win every game. With that said, knowing these combos will help you to consistently eliminate threats and defeat your opponents.  

##### Combo 1
**Note:** The {Pot of Greed} represents any "Spellbook” card
