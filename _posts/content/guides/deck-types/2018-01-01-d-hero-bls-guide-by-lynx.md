### Introduction  

What’s up everyone, I’ve been meaning to do write-ups on other stuff for a while now but I never came around to actually doing so. Instead, I decided to make a little guide for this specific D-heroes build. I’ve been almost exclusively using this build since Destiny Heroes were released and I think I’ve accumulated enough experience to share some thoughts now. This guide is specifically geared towards players wanting to use a {Black Luster Soldier - Sacred Soldier} version of Destiny Heroes, which is a Fusion-themed deck. 

In this guide I will elaborate on many aspects of this deck such as card count, viable skills and reasons for inclusion (or exclusion) of individual cards.  

### Will this archetype suit me as a player?

D-Hero BLS Fusion is a deck that is best played defensively at first, until the time to strike is right and overwhelm. Its sheer amount of options gives it outs to nearly every meta deck but it’s easy to overextend. Decision making is very precise and a lot of times the most obvious play will not be the best. If you’re not willing to be patient, this might not be the deck for you. In any other case I encourage you to go for it and don’t give up!

Here is the decklist I have used to reach KoG. By no means do I claim this is the actual best build for this archetype, it is just one I personally feel is pretty solid at this moment. It’s nice and simple, doesn’t have too many bells and whistles but is very tweakable at the same time if needed.

**But Lynx, why 25 cards? 20 seems better for consistency.**

First of all, you’re right. 20 card decks are certainly by default better for consistency and I’m not denying there are 20 card builds that perform just as well or even better than this build. However, there are a few reasons why I think that this build in particular can justify running 25, 28 or even 30 cards with little to no drawback. First of them being that the the BLS/Vyon milling engine sets up for the D-Hero drawing engine very fast. The fact that the cards it mills are plentiful and not random greatly increases chances of drawing into your support cards when you need them. Then why not keep the BLS engine and cut other cards? Valid point, but it leaves you with 2 options: either cut cards from the D-Hero engine or cut tech cards, both of which seem like bad ideas. I’m not saying 25 is the magic number but after lots and lots of playtesting at least it fits the pace.

**Why {Restart}?**

It is very important to open with certain cards, but for this deck leaving certain cards inside the deck because you want to keep them there for the time being (such as Malicious and BLS) is just as important if you want to start off as steady as possible. Even though the deck has plenty good cards to open with and real bricking is hardly a thing, Restart offers a way to get rid of those few key cards that are better left inside the deck at the beginning of a duel.

### The BLS / Vyon Engine  

<br>
[deck](Beginning of Heaven and Earth;Black Luster Soldier - Sacred Soldier;Vision Hero Vyon)
<br>

* 2-3 × {Beginning of Heaven and Earth}:  
(Core card, Deck Thinner, Searcher)  
First of all, the Beginning of Heaven and Earth (BoHaE) engine is great. It is the main reason I stuck with BLS in the first place instead of opting for other builds. Since it is a trap card it is inherently slow but it is chainable at all times, which helps in the current meta. BoHaE allows you to pick 3 Warrior type mons from your deck including at least 1 Black Luster Soldier monster, of which at least 2 will be sent to the GY after resolving. This is HUGE for D-Heroes as the GY is the one place you’ll want to be dumping most of them so the deck can pop off consequently PLUS you get to pick your exact pieces, which makes it that much more versatile. As a result, you will want this card as soon as possible, most preferably in the opening hand. You will run into late-game situations where you draw this card and not be able to activate it because there are no BLS left in the deck. This can be mitigated by running more copies of BLS, but that increases your chances to brick. I would advise to keep your BLS:BoHaE ratio close to equal and only add the 3rd BLS when you’re playing a number of cards closer to 30. Lastly, I’d like to add that there is no ‘best card combination’ to mill with this card. It will come down to what your playing against and what is already in the GY. As a rule thumb, you can remember that it is generally not a bad idea to send {Destiny HERO - Malicious} early game.

* 2-3 × {Black Luster Soldier - Sacred Soldier} / BLS:SS / BLS:  
(Core card, Semi-Boss Monster, Recycler)  
BLS: SS has been seeing play here and there for quite a while now, mostly in experimental decks, but never as a top tier threat. One reason in particular that it is viable to run is because the deck can deal with either outcome of BoHaE (BLS added to hand, BLS sent to grave) really well. While the outcome is partly influenceable by picking more or less copies of BLS at activation, it does remain a matter of RNG so being able to not really care about the outcome most of the time is neat and feels secure.  
I'd like to point out that I’m not an advocate of builds like this teching in specific cards to ease up a BLS summon, such as {Destiny HERO - Dasher} and {Dawn Knight}. Instead, I feel these builds should mainly focus on dumping other Destiny Heroes to set up the GY as it pays off more in the long run and allows you to draw into tech cards earlier. Especially the Dasher/Dawn combo can really screw you if your opponent manages to choose BLS, potentially leaving you with a Dawn Knight on top of your deck and a dead hand. All in all, BLS should hardly ever be seen as a win-con, but more so as a handy equip for {Red-Eyes Slash Dragon}, a way to tribute off monsters or simply extra discard fodder. That said, a raw summon will win you the occasional game as it will be your best option every once in a while.  
Lastly, there’s two extra things to consider:  
1: BLS on summon pulls back a banished DARK or LIGHT monster, meaning it allows you to recycle {Destiny HERO - Celestial} and {Destiny HERO - Dreamer}’s effects.  
2: When BLS destroys by battle, you can choose to add a Warrior back to your hand. Consider whether you need this (Vyon is a good choice). Sometimes it might be better to keep cards in the GY.

* 2-3 × {Vision HERO Vyon}:  
(Core Card, Deck Thinner, Searcher)  
On summon, this card will send 1 HERO monster of your choice to the GY, meaning that of your two milling options this is the faster one. Most of the time you’ll want to be dumping Malicious early game so you have that sweet free special summon available, which can be used instantly or kept in the back of your trunk for some nasty combos later on. It’s second effect allows you to pull a {Polymerization} from your deck at the cost of banishing a HERO monster from the GY. Plan out when deciding to do so, so that you don’t rushingly banish a HERO and realize you’d actually rather have it in the GY next turn. Similar to D-Heroes, Vyon can also serve as a fusion material for all Fusion monsters being a DARK Warrior-type monster.  
Like with BoHaE there is no best card to mill and it depends on the situation (I’ll try to cover as much as possible in the matchups section).

---

### The Destiny Hero Engine

After some milling has passed, this engine makes it possible to thin even more to draw into your tech cards faster while continuing to provide fusion materials. It is **CRUCIAL** to keep track of which D-Heroes are in the GY at all times so you can anticipate and weigh your options correctly. Do not forget that next to having useful effects, D-heroes are the only cards in this deck that qualify as fusion material for ALL 3 boss monsters AND are able to fuse with other copies of itself for Dangerous (Vyon and Dark Hex cannot) and thus are the most versatile monsters.  

<br>
[deck](Destiny Hero - Celestial;Destiny Hero - Dreamer;Destiny Hero - Malicious;Destiny Draw;Destiny Hero - Dangerous)
<br>

* 3 × {Destiny HERO - Celestial}:  
(Core Card, Deck Thinner, Situational Beater, Fusion Material)  
Celestial is basically a once per turn {Pot of Greed} when properly set up. Its drawbacks are that firstly you cannot do pop the drawing effect the same turn you send this card to the graveyard and your hand will have to be empty. The first drawback can be mitigated by sending it on your opponent’s turn with BoHaE or Dangerous, while the latter can be mitigated by setting your backrow and discarding potential hand bricks like BLS through your Dangerous, {Fusion Recycling Plant} or {Snipe Hunter}. Also note that its description says ‘this card’ and not ‘Destiny Hero - Celestial’, so sending one won’t block the another from activating that turn. As a bonus, this monster can serve as your main non-fusion beater and it’s second effect will allow you to pop face-up spells on attack declaration, making certain matchups way more doable (for example {Sea Stealth Attack} decks). 

* 2 × {Destiny HERO - Dreamer}:  
(Core Card, Deck Thin Fuel, Protection, Fusion Material)  
The next best D-Hero that can either be used to fuel Celestials effect or to protecc another D-Hero from destruction. Offensively you have the option use this to swing into damage altering backrow such as {Mirror Wall} and {Wall of Disruption} and live another day. However, this card is best suited to be played defensively due to the fact that it will be an extra monster for you to fuse (or tribute) if you can keep it on the field, which is accomplished easier coming from your opponent’s turn. Also keep in mind that when special summoned by this effect, it will banish itself when it leaves the field, losing it’s ability to fuel Celestial. To summarize, I think Dreamer’s effect should only be activated if you are confident you will get value out of it. Otherwise keep it in the GY and use it for draws. Once again, plan ahead.

* 2 × {Destiny HERO - Malicious}:  
(Core Card, Searcher, Deck Thin Fuel, Fusion Material, Tribute Fodder)  
Konami released only 2 of this card, effectively semi-limiting it, and I can see why. Malicious can banish itself from the graveyard to summon another copy of itself from the deck, essentially being a near-unstoppable free summon. From there it can be used for practically anything. 
Taking this and the fact that it’s a level 6 monsters into account it also deserves a medal for being by far the worst card to draw in your opening hand if you don’t have way to get rid of it asap. Restart please.

* 1 × {Destiny Draw}:  
(Deck thinner)  
Available at merely one copy, this is your free ‘dump 1, draw 2’ deck thinner. Extremely potent if you draw it early but can still turn be useful mid-game. Can become a dead draw pretty fast however as you fuse and dump your D-Heroes. Worth noting too that as it’s a Normal Spell card, you can set it, pop Celestial, draw a D-Hero and still activate after setting, netting you a total of 5 draws in one turn. (Did someone say {Exodia the Forbidden One}?)  
Even though I consider this a core card, the fact that it can be the most dead of the bunch as well makes it a bit shaky at times. 

* 2 × {Destiny HERO - Dangerous}:  
(Core Card, Boss Monster, Discarding Tool)  
This 2000/2600 body is the one you’ll Fusion summon first most of the time. With these stats and potential attack boosting it’s capable of swinging both ways, offense and defense. Its effect lets you discard any card to boost its attack plus it’s a quick effect altering damage output, meaning it can be activated during the damage step, making it a very potent discarding tool at any given time. The way to play this card is so dependent on the matchup that it’s hard to say much else up here. Lastly it is worth remembering that it also fuses into itself (even with itself, lmao) or the other fusions if needed.

### General Fusion Cards

* 1-2 × {Fusion Recycling Plant} (FRP):  
(Searcher, Discarding Tool)  
I bet you’re wondering: why not just run 3 Poly (other than wanting to effectively run more than 3 Poly)? The first answer is that it’s better in the long run. Let’s do some math assuming 4 cards in an opening hand:  

**Poly vs FRP:**  
* Activate Poly (-1)  drop 2 monsters to GY (-2), summon Fusion monster (+1) = -2  

* Activate FRP (-1), discard 1 card (-1), grab Polymerization (+1), Activate Poly (-1), 2 monsters to GY (-2), Summon Fusion monster (+1), get back 1 material in End Phase (+1) = -2  
From this we can conclude that the outcome is the same in the end, so what is the actual difference?  

The above calculation is true for the first Fusion summon. However, let’s blow things out of perspective for a short minute. Imagine you could run 100 copies of Poly, and use all of them for fusing 200 monsters in total after FRP has been activated once. At the end of this, you would now have gotten back 100 of those 200 monsters, effectively generating less disadvantage. What this ultimately means is that the more you fuse, the more value this card gives.  

For the second part of the answer, let’s also review some situations. Let’s say you have an empty field, a hand with BLS, Dreamer, Dark Hex and Poly and a Celestial in the GY that’s activatable. You really want to use Polymerization to fuse into Slash Dragon instead of Dangerous because it is your best option, but then you’re left with a BLS in hand that prevents you from using Celestial’s effect and no way to get rid of it.   

Now let’s say you have the same hand, but with FRP instead of Poly. You can now use FRP to discard BLS, fetch a Poly and fuse your monsters into Slash Dragon. It leaves you without any cards in hand, but now you’re able to pop Celestial’s effect on top of which a D-Hero (of choice) returns to hand in the End Phase. Replace BLS in this situation with a dead BoHaE (that you can’t even use for Storm anymore) or a Bacon Saver and you also end up with more value.   

Imagine a similar situation with any card in hand that’s not playable and preventing Celestial from activating. You will always be able to trade for Poly and set Poly to be able activate Celestial.   

That said, there will be situations in which Poly is a flat out better draw. For example when you have 2 fusible monsters on the field and you need to topdeck Poly, but instead draw FRP and have nothing to discard and no Celestial to pop. GG.  

Ultimately I don’t think FRP is always the better card but in this deck it puts in work, especially as the duel progresses.  

* 1-3 × {Polymerization}:  
As we have seen, depending on the number of cards in your deck and your available copies of Fusion Recycling Plant (FRP), the number of Polymerization in your deck can be adjusted. Personally I run 1 Poly and 2 Plant, as I find Vyon’s effect to pull it from the deck early game to be pretty consistent in general. The downside of running only 1 Poly is that if something happens to it and it gets banished, you cannot get it back.

### Other Core Cards  

This category includes cards that are not part of any engine within this deck, but provide insane additional value to the deck as they sync up perfectly. They are too good to pass up and hence carry the label of core cards.  

* 1 × {Vision HERO Trinity}:  
(Boss Monster, Fusion Material, Cyber Angel Slayer)  
This card absolutely benefits from backrow hate and will most definitely close out the game when you opponent has 2 or more attack position monsters and no way to change its battle position. Always keep him in mind as an option as it can be brutal after a {Storm} / {Hey, Trunade!} sweep. 

* 2 × {The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion}:  
(Fusion Material)  
This card not only serves as an extra fusion material for all fusions, but also allows you to fuse from the field, which is great when you don’t have Poly readily available. Similarly, it can be used with Poly as well, which can come in clutch when you draw into one of these and a Poly using Celestial’s effect. The main reason I run this is because it opens up the way to Red-Eyes Slash Dragon, which I feel is a great asset to this deck as you will read below. 

* 2 × {Red-Eyes Slash Dragon}:  
(Boss Monster, Fusion Material)  
I love this card so much. Even though people have learned to play against it, the pressure this card puts on people is undeniable. A lot of times you will be in a spot in which you are able to choose between fusing Dangerous and RESD. It is very tempting to go for RESD in most of these situations. My general advice is to not be greedy unless you are absolutely sure you can lock your opponent down with RESD. Otherwise go for Dangerous and try to feel your opponent out first. 

---

### Tech Cards

These are the cards that are specifically in my build because I like them, but can certainly be replaced by other cards. The great thing about this deck is that its drawing power allows you to see your tech cards often. Don’t be afraid to raise the number of tech cards if you feel like you need them. 

* 2 × {Powerful Rebirth}:  
(Recycle)  
In decks that rely on sending small monsters to the graveyard all the time, it’s no surprise that Powerful Rebirth comes to mind. Use this card in conjunction with Dreamer’s protection effect and you should be able to get 2 monsters on the field out of nowhere ready to be fused next turn. This card also gives other monsters like Snipe Hunter a second shot at life, should you havelost it the first time. 

* 1 × {Snipe Hunter}:  
(Discarding tool, Destruction Effect)  
I’m not really a fan of this card, but as a one-of it covers a lot the deck might struggle with without it. Snipe Hunter is basically another win-con against burn/stall decks, making your deck all that more potent to break through. The great thing is that playing against stall gives you time to set up your GY as well so that when the time comes, you can Snipe away, feeding of Celestial draws in the process. Knowing when you’re facing these kind of decks early is key. Outside of this, it is still a decent card to get your unwanted D-Heroes/BLS into the grave and like Bacon Saver, it also counts as a fusion material for Dangerous. Sniping away and then fusing is real now.

* 1 × {Bacon Saver}:  
(Fusion Material, Protection)  
Doesn’t this card belong in Red-Eyes Zombies? You are right and unlike REZ this deck does not even have a straight up way to mill this card from the deck so you will end up with it in hand a lot of the time. Why still include it? Being able to negate an attack (even your own) is simply still really powerful. Getting it from your hand to the GY should be fairly easy as outside of being fodder for Snipe Hunter, Dangerous and FRP it should not be forgotten that it can also serve as fusion material for Dangerous itself. Fusing Bacon is real too. 

* 1-2 × {Storm}:  
(Backrow Removal)  
The only form of straight up backrow removal in this deck. It syncs well with Powerful Rebirths and BoHaE since they are chainable to it and creates space for other plays like setting backrow to activate Celestial. Best used when going in for the OTK with your boss Fusion Monsters and. very neat against stall too. I recommend only one copy as it will be bricky early on when you do not have your Powerful Rebirths or BoHaE yet, but another copy for the sidedeck wouldn’t hurt. 
Playing FRP gives you the opportunity to sweep 3.

### Other options:

This section will provide some alternative options, mostly tech cards. A lot centered around backrow hate.  

* {Phantom Magician}:  
Can search Vyon, Malicious and Dreamer.

* {Hey, Trunade!}:  
A viable (and probably even better but haven’t been able to test yet) alternative to Storm.

* {Fenghuang}:  
Other backrow hate. I have this card side decked usually. It’s tribute summon is pretty easy to get off in general but keep in mind it returns to the hand.

* {Anti-Magic Arrows}:  
Another alternative to Storm. I would not recommend it as you cannot activate it after setting, should you have to do that to pop Celestial.

* {Enemy Controller}:  
For obvious reasons.

### MATCHUPS: 
* **(COMING SOON!)**

### Conclusion:

It is **CRUCIAL** to track how many Heroes are in the GY and which ones are banished **AT ALL TIMES**. It will make it that much easier to think ahead. Weigh your options and be patient. It will win you games, especially with this deck.. 

As it is a fusion deck, it has loads of opportunities to check for backrow (loads of activation prompts) so if your opponent doesn’t play with the toggle pay attention.
