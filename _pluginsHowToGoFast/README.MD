## Info

1. If you don't need decks
    --> DRAG plugins 6 to this folder

3. Run "jekyll serve"

  First time will take around 45 seconds
  All next regenerations will take around 6 seconds!

4. When you're done, drag the plugin back to _plugins!

## Extra

If you don't take out plugin 6, then
  1. The generation will take up way longer and
  2. The regeneration will end up in an endless loop


Happy coding,
