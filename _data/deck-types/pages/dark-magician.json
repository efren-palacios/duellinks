And the newest addition to Duel Links, Arkana, has made this an actual viable deck in game, placing it under Notable Kog Decks. As much as I'd hate to say it, Dark Magician is not a strong tournament deck. But it still has the power to annihilate top tier decks and it has already been proven to be a King of Games deck. "
