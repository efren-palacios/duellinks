It uses {Volcanic Rocket} to search for these cards, {Volcanic Shell} as discard fodder and {Royal Firestorm Guards} in order to recycle the Volcanic Shells and out resource the opponent. It is played as a control based deck which slowly grinds out the opponent's monsters and attacks the opponent directly when the field is cleared, slowly chipping away at their life points."
