By doing so, you set-up your special summons and quickly draw into your big plays. With the recent release of That Grass Looks Greener, a 30 card Magnet deck has taken advantage of its use. Alongside Triamid Pulse, the 30 card Grass Magnet deck has taken many by surprise. With the milling capabilities of the Magnet Warrior engine combined with That Grass Looks Greener, Triamid Pulse uses those rock monsters in the graveyard to banish them to activate one of its many effects. That being said, with the easy special summon capabilities of Gaia Plate the Earth Giant and Valkyrion the Magna Warrior, this deck can easily defeat your opponent in one turn or disrupt their entire field."

Try to save Beta the Electromagnets second effect until the your opponent's end phase, that way you can prevent any targeting effects on it during your opponent's turn. Before sending Delta the Magnet Warrior to your graveyard to special summon Valkyrion the Magna Warrior, check to see if you have the correct monsters in the graveyard first (3 Magnet warriors but none can be Delta the Magnet Warrior). When special summoning Gaia Plate the Earth Giant before Valkyrion the Magna Warrior, try to banish Delta the Magnet Warriors from your graveyard as fuel for Gaia Plate the Earth Giant because if you banish 2 of the 4 possible monsters needed for Valkyrion (1 Electromagnet and 3 Beta), then he becomes a dead card."
