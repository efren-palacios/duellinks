The general strategy of the deck is to use your Gladiator Beast monsters in battle. This will allow you to return that Gladiator to the deck to special summon another with a different name. This mechanic is commonly referred to as “tagging out” and this is how it will be named on this page and the guide. When a Gladiator Beast is tagged in that monster gains an effect. For example, Gladiator Beast Bestiari will allow you to destroy any spell of trap card on the field when tagged in. Meanwhile, Gladiator Beast Murmillo will let you destroy a monster. These tagging effects mean the deck can deal with almost any board state and generate card advantage every turn. Gladiator Beasts also have three fusion monsters which you can “tag in” buy returning their fusion material monsters from the field back to the deck without using cards like polymerisation. This gives the deck access to powerful boss monsters and gives the deck extra utility. Gladiator beasts have been the go to control deck in Duel Links for some time."

                    "paragraph": "The strength of the deck is its versatility. The core of the deck is between seven and eight monsters. This gives the deck between twelve and thirteen tech spots which you can customize to have favorable match-ups against a specific group of decks. Additionally, there is a huge number of skills which the deck can make use of; Balance remains the most popular skill but players have had success with mind scan, shadow game, no mortal can resist and three star demotion to name but a few. While the diversity of the metagame has hindered the Gladiator Beast archetype over the last month, the deck can definitely still compete in a tournament format where the side deck can be built to beat decks which the main is weak against. It is also a good option for “team war” formats where you can build to counter one specific deck and remain versatile enough for the decks which follow after that."

Both had two copies of Cosmic Cyclone and at least one Wall of Disruption in their side decks. SilchasRuin also sided Disappear while BBDz sided Foolish return. It is not a coincidence that both top 16 builds were identical and had similar side decks. This was likely the optimal Gladiator Beast Deck before Rampage of the Forest released."
