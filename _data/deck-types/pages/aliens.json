Some Aliens are able to use A-counters to reduce enemy monsters attack and defense, and will have the text (If a monster with an A-Counter battles an Alien monster, it loses 300 ATK and DEF for each A-Counter during damage calculation only.) This effect stacks for each Alien monster on the field. Aliens have been labeled as the best F2P and new player friendly Deck in Duel Links with only one core Super Rare card. Alien decks are extremely versitile and have room for situational tech cards, making them a strong deck for experienced players as well."
