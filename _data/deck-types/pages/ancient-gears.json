They can Tribute Summon {Ancient Gear Golem} either through normal means or by the effect of {Ancient Gear Castle}."

What makes Ancient Gears so good is how the monsters deal with Backrow in a way; Ancient Gear monsters are safe from cards like Wall of Disruption, while Sergeant Electro locks down or forces sub-optimal activation of the opponent’s cards. All this while you focus your own backrow to have control over you opponent’s frontrow."
