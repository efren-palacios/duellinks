Rez can keep it's core cards and adapt to the meta as the meta evolves each month. The decks main engine revloves around gozuki, the most important card of the deck next to red-eyes Zombie. The deck can be played two ways, as an agressive otk deck, or an semi agressive control deck depending on the techs you run in the deck. For example a rez deck that has only anti back row and 3 Econs besides it's core cards, is built for otk, the Rez decks that run wall of disruption, mirror walls, snipe Hunter and other techs, run more like a control deck. Both versions of this deck dominate in competitive Tournaments as well as the latter on DL pvp. The biggest draw back of this deck is it's ability to start you off with completely unplayable hands, this doesn't happen too often but happens often enough to make us Rez players pull the hair out of our heads.."
