This deck is based on an engine powered by the multiple effects of it's boss monster, Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon and it's most imperative zombie monster, Gozuki. This is a very explosive otk deck that uses the best combo card in the game, Red-Eyes insight and the trap card, red-eyes spirit to flood the field with powerful 2400 atk/ 2000def monsters. This deck has much room for techs and powerful staple cards suck as enemy controller which helps it counter any weakness it may have."
