Red-Eyes Zombies can keep it's core cards and tech in certain cards to adapt to the meta as it evolves. The decks main engine revloves around Gozuki, the most important card of the deck next to Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon. The deck can be played two ways: as an agressive OTK (One Turn Kill) deck or a semi-agressive control deck depending on the tech cards you run. For example, a REZ deck that has only anti-backrow, 3 Enemy Controllers and it's core cards is built for an OTK. The REZ decks that run {Wall of Disruption}, {Mirror Wall}s, {Snipe Hunter} and other techs play more like a control deck. Both versions of this deck dominate in competitive tournaments as well as the Duel Links Ranked ladder. The biggest drawback of this deck is it's ability to start you off with completely unplayable hands. This doesn't happen often but happens enough to make REZ players pull the hair out of their heads."
