So I played CA only varient and ran TRAIN to Legend 2. I've played the varient with econ and cosmic cyclone and I think CA only is best. Went to bed and woke up playing but my WR dropped and couldnt get KOG so I just ran burn because I noticed not a lot of control decks or AG decks.","main0":"Lava Golem","main1":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main2":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main3":"Sphere Kuriboh","main4":"Inaba White Rabbit","main5":"Enemy Controller","main6":"Enemy Controller","main7":"Jade Insect Whistle","main8":"Jade Insect Whistle","main9":"Mask of the Accursed","main10":"Mask of the Accursed","main11":"Mask of the Accursed","main12":"Draining Shield","main13":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Massivemorph","main17":"Massivemorph","main18":"Massivemorph","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2017-12-14T20:35:14.699Z"}
