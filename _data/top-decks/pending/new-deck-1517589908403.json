Nothing to say about this deck actually, the top 2 players of MCS 5 were playing Saffira, so yeah. I just dislike playing 3 Saffiras, 2 is just fine for me:)\r\nAnti Magic Arrows was the real mvp, pushing me through some decks with no chances to interrupt. Sometimes bricky, but most of the time helped me rush my wajio to the Kog. I didn’t expect a lot of mirror matches, so only 1 E-Con. If you want more consistency - take one AMA out for a Petit Angel, but it wouldn’t matter too much.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main2":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main3":"Cyber Angel Benten","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main7":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main10":"Sonic Bird","main11":"Sonic Bird","main12":"Anti-Magic Arrows","main13":"Anti-Magic Arrows","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Hymn of Light","main16":"Hymn of Light","main17":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main18":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main19":"Machine Angel Ritual","date":"2018-02-02T16:45:08.402Z","commentDate":"2018-02-02T16:45:08.402Z","timestamp":1517589908,"layout":"post"}
