Chaos hunter is mandatory with the amount of Amazoness in the game right now, run at least 2 of them. SK is great to stop OTKs and econ take plays and also is fodder for Call of the Archfiend. If you have Lyla obviously play her over Jain. Card Trooper is very risky and not worth it IMO. Hope this helps anyone that wants to play this fun archetype.","main0":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main1":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main2":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main3":"Archfiend Empress","main4":"Archfiend Empress","main5":"Archfiend Empress","main6":"Chaos Hunter","main7":"Chaos Hunter","main8":"Jain, Lightsworn Paladin","main9":"Snipe Hunter","main10":"Sphere Kuriboh","main11":"Sphere Kuriboh","main12":"Archfiend's Roar","main13":"Archfiend's Roar","main14":"Archfiend's Roar","main15":"Call of the Archfiend","main16":"Call of the Archfiend","main17":"Call of the Archfiend","main18":"Needlebug Nest","main19":"Needlebug Nest","date":"2018-05-08T04:59:39.028Z","tags":["comment-subscription"],"layout":"post","message":" ","visible":true,"excerpt_separator":"<!--more-->","draft":true,"timestamp":1525755579}
