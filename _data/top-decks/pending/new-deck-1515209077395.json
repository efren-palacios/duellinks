Instead of defaulting to the op decks, I decided to hit KoG with this Genex deck. Inspiration came from the top 16 genex deck in meta weekly, but I decided to play my own take on it. This version relies on Sleight of Hand, Electro and backrows to stall until Army comes out to finish the game. Overall, a super fun deck that I’d recommend anyone play, since I believe it’ll be even stronger post-banlist.","main0":"Genex Army","main1":"Genex Army","main2":"Genex Searcher","main3":"Genex Searcher","main4":"Genex Searcher","main5":"Sergeant Electro","main6":"Sergeant Electro","main7":"Genex Turbine","main8":"Genex Turbine","main9":"Genex Turbine","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Curse of Anubis","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Mirror Wall","main18":"Mirror Wall","main19":"Pulse Mines","date":"2018-01-06T03:24:37.395Z"}
