No Bacon in hand for my 5 straight L3 games (but those opponents weren't too challenging either). Divine Wrath on a Kuriboh felt good.","main0":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main1":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main2":"Red-Eyes Wyvern","main3":"Gozuki","main4":"Gozuki","main5":"Gozuki","main6":"Samurai Skull","main7":"Samurai Skull","main8":"Bacon Saver","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Red-Eyes Insight","main12":"Red-Eyes Insight","main13":"Red-Eyes Insight","main14":"Storm","main15":"Storm","main16":"Super Rush Headlong","main17":"Super Rush Headlong","main18":"Divine Wrath","main19":"Red-Eyes Spirit","main20":"Red-Eyes Spirit","date":"2018-01-24T00:54:16.425Z"}
