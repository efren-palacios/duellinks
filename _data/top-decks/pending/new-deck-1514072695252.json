It did fairly well vs CA and Ninjas on the ladder but I think they were not playing optimally. Plays similarly to other control decks but you have cool options like searcher and army. Sleight of hand is very useful for getting over big monsters and can be triggered with mirror wall. I kept playing around with the back row options so feel free to experiment. Econ, mirror wall, and pulse mines are very good in this deck though. I want more people to get KOG with this deck so feel free to ask me for more advice. If someone wants to help me optimize it vs the best decks id consider bringing it to MCS but I don’t think it’ll be able to consistently beat top players with top decks.","main0":"Genex Army","main1":"R-Genex Ultimum","main2":"Genex Searcher","main3":"Genex Searcher","main4":"Sergeant Electro","main5":"Sergeant Electro","main6":"Sergeant Electro","main7":"Genex Turbine","main8":"Genex Turbine","main9":"Genex Turbine","main10":"Sphere Kuriboh","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Super Rush Headlong","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Mirror Wall","main17":"Mirror Wall","main18":"Pulse Mines","main19":"Pulse Mines","date":"2017-12-23T23:44:55.251Z"}
