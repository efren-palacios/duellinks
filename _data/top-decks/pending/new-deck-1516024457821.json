{"_id":"9406ca70-f9fb-11e7-b2d1-c1e0adb3ae7e","name":"Hero Control","deckType":"control-decks","skill":"Where the Heroes Dwell","author":"Jenga","notes":"The deck has two abilities. 1) Dealing with heavy back row 2) Overrunning strong monsters such as buffed Dinos, AGs, Laquari, Hazies, REZ.\r\nThe advantages of Sergeant and most of the S/Ts are obvious.\r\nWildeheart is immune to Traps and with Skyscraper can overruns most monsters.\r\nNeos is acceptably strong in itself and gets to 2900 with Skyscraper outmatching everything but Golem and a buffed Dakiny. 2 seems optimal to me since he doesn’t bring anything to the table but ATK.\r\nChow Lei is a weaker Sergeant and can probably be replaced. Impenetrable Attack is just so annoying so I added it.\r\nCosmic cyclone is useful for the End Phase and can trigger Skyscraper.\r\nA second Floodgate would be better but I don’t have it. Wall of D should get kicked for that imo.\r\nMirror Wall tiggers Skyscraper and protects a second turn making it pretty good in this deck. The 3rd one could be replaced.\r\n\r\nThe deck is probably not good to win a MCS as sooner or later you’ll loose due to a brick monster hand. For a KC cup is seems ok though as it can deal with a large range of decks.\r\nThe skill buff would have helped occasionally. I don’t think it will make the deck that much better though.","main0":"Elemental HERO Neos Alius","main1":"Elemental HERO Neos Alius","main2":"Chow Len the Prophet","main3":"Sergeant Electro","main4":"Sergeant Electro","main5":"Sergeant Electro","main6":"Elemental HERO Wildheart","main7":"Elemental HERO Wildheart","main8":"Elemental HERO Wildheart","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Super Rush Headlong","main11":"Super Rush Headlong","main12":"Super Rush Headlong","main13":"Curse of Anubis","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Mirror Wall","main16":"Mirror Wall","main17":"Mirror Wall","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Windstorm of Etaqua","date":"2018-01-15T13:54:17.821Z"}
