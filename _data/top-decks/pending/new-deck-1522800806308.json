Only one rebirth is not good so would replace the spiritual art card with rebirth if u have em. The idea with magnets is that u mill the small guys for big plays. If ur valk dies u got Gaia plate and snipe hunter so it ain't too bad. Remember: if deltas on the field and vanillas beta/ electro betas are going in the grave ur doing something right.","main0":"Valkyrion the Magna Warrior","main1":"Gaia Plate the Earth Giant","main2":"Delta The Magnet Warrior","main3":"Delta The Magnet Warrior","main4":"Delta The Magnet Warrior","main5":"Beta The Electromagnet Warrior","main6":"Snipe Hunter","main7":"Beta The Magnet Warrior","main8":"Beta The Magnet Warrior","main9":"Beta The Magnet Warrior","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Downbeat","main12":"Downbeat","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Storm","main17":"Storm","main18":"Powerful Rebirth","main19":"Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane","main20":"Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane","date":"2018-04-04T00:13:26.308Z"}
