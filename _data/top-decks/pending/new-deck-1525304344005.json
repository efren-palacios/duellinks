I think Im the 1st to rly use 3SD with them. I dont think my build is fully optimal, but I see the potential. I missplayed quite a bit at 1st, definitely not an easy deck to use. Its a lot of fun doe and rewards carefully managing your resources. \r\nI think Spellbooks def. have a place in the meta, Fate is just such a strong card and the engine is super consistent, I bricked once I think and even then was able to stall with Kazejin.\r\nI obv use Kazejin because he is a spellcaster and with power is able to beat over the biggest mons in the meta.\r\nTook me 36 wins total, started with a grass build in plat 4  but soon switched to this in legend because I wanted to try 3SD because it was actually the 1st thing I thought about when books were leaked.","main0":"Kazejin","main1":"Kazejin","main2":"Kazejin","main3":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main4":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main5":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main6":"Enemy Controller","main7":"Spellbook Library of the Heliosphere","main8":"Spellbook of Eternity","main9":"Spellbook of Eternity","main10":"Spellbook of Fate","main11":"Spellbook of Fate","main12":"Spellbook of Fate","main13":"Spellbook of Power","main14":"Spellbook of Secrets","main15":"Spellbook of Secrets","main16":"Spellbook of Secrets","main17":"Spellbook of the Master","main18":"Spellbook of the Master","main19":"Spellbook of the Master","main20":"Treacherous Trap Hole","date":"2018-05-02T23:39:04.004Z","tags":[]}
