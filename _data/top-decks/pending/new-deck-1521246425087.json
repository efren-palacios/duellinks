My ideal opening hand is Rose Lover, Komushroomo, E Con, and any Lv 6, 7, or 8 monster. If you can identify what kind of deck your opponent is playing when going second Rose Lover is a great opening card. Otherwise when going first Komushroomo is almost always better esp without pertection from an E Con. Having Komushroomo mill Carrot or a Rose Lover is almost always a win. The stars of the deck without question is Rose Lover, Carrot, and Marina(just for the SSA match up).\r\n\r\nIn my KOG run I played 2 Legendary Fisherman/SSA decks, 1 Saffira/CA, and 2 Destiny Heroes. Honestly I started at 0 games legend 1 and made it to the KOG match and lost to a OTK mirror match. Then I won my next 4 games and lost to an OTK  Weevile burn. Then I dominated my next 5 matches for KOG.","main0":"Mari√±a, Princess of Sunflowers","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Hermitree","main3":"World Carrotweight Champion","main4":"World Carrotweight Champion","main5":"Sylvan Flowerknight","main6":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main7":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main8":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main9":"Rose Lover","main10":"Rose Lover","main11":"Rose Lover","main12":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main13":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main14":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main15":"Gigaplant","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Enemy Controller","main18":"Raging Mad Plants","main19":"Hey, Trunade!","date":"2018-03-17T00:27:05.087Z","layout":"post"}
