Because I didn't want to get to KoG really, I've decided to try Jurrac's which I would later try to get KoG on stream.\r\n\r\nWell, I got LUCKY and went on a 5 win streak with this  JURRAC deck. Don't expect to win alot with it though, I doubt I could do a full legend climb with it. Well, so late to the season it might be possible.","main0":"Jurrac Herra","main1":"Jurrac Herra","main2":"Jurrac Herra","main3":"Jurrac Guaiba","main4":"Jurrac Guaiba","main5":"Sergeant Electro","main6":"Sergeant Electro","main7":"Jurrac Ptera","main8":"Jurrac Ptera","main9":"Jurrac Ptera","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Fossil Dig","main13":"Curse of Anubis","main14":"Divine Wrath","main15":"Impenetrable Attack","main16":"Impenetrable Attack","main17":"Mirror Wall","main18":"Mirror Wall","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-01-23T12:41:33.028Z"}
