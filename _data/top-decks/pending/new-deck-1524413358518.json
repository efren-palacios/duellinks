On the one side, I'm pretty glad that Konami gives us f2p people a way to participate, on the other side, the mirror can become quite tedious. The list I used is from tommymon's video on the kc cup and I'm pretty pleased with it. Restart is a must I think, or you sometimes cannot really interact with your opponents. The Lotuswain is nice, as it allows you to cycle through your deck multiple times and win grindy games. All in all, I was pleased how much every decision matters and you can certainly gain an edge if you play well.","main0":"Sylvan Hermitree","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Guardioak","main3":"Sylvan Guardioak","main4":"Sylvan Guardioak","main5":"Sylvan Lotuswain","main6":"World Carrotweight Champion","main7":"World Carrotweight Champion","main8":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main9":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main10":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main11":"Rose Lover","main12":"Rose Lover","main13":"Rose Lover","main14":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main15":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main16":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main17":"Enemy Controller","main18":"Enemy Controller","main19":"Ultimate Providence","main20":"Ultimate Providence","date":"2018-04-22T16:09:18.518Z"}
