I got to about legend 3 with only 1 laquari somehow, but Id definitely run 3 if I had it, likely replace the 2nd Dimicari with it. I felt like the art of twos worked better with my main spell/trap lineup 2 Floodgate and WOD for the pesky hazy matchup plus a random SRH since tonight I actually faced 6 hazy in a row. CC is nice because without mindscan it lets you get rid of a random facedown that might actually hurt you if you attacked with a glad before tagging out. Could swap out the walls for mirror walls, but again did not have them. Not the most optimal deck but it did what I needed it to do.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Super Rush Headlong","main13":"Curse of Anubis","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Impenetrable Attack","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","extra0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","extra1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","extra2":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","date":"2017-12-21T14:31:29.583Z"}
