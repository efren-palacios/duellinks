I don't think it would be a great tourney deck but it's great for the ladder. XZH is the what ever you think works best utility card, it was my hero opening vs Aliens. Biggest problem I had was with Hazy, but that was only if I didnt get WOD early. Pretty fun deck and like most new box decks a lot of the ladder has no idea what to do against it yet.","main0":"Golden Flying Fish","main1":"Golden Flying Fish","main2":"Golden Flying Fish","main3":"Hammer Shark","main4":"Hammer Shark","main5":"Hammer Shark","main6":"Oyster Meister","main7":"Oyster Meister","main8":"Oyster Meister","main9":"Beautunaful Princess","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Fish Depth Charge","main14":"Powerful Rebirth","main15":"Powerful Rebirth","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Wall of Disruption","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Xing Zhen Hu","date":"2018-03-03T23:14:21.531Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
