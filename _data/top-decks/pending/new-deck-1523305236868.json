Maybe if you have 3 ties it might be worth running but I much preferred the deck when I dropped it\r\n2) Paleozoic Canadia is great. Stops Mask Change, activation effect monsters, hymn / Mar protection etc as well as an attack\r\nWould run an extra maybe in place of powerful / chalice / the last monster\r\n3) it doesn't target, so don't be an idiot like me and forget vs hazy\r\n4) pulse mines should often be used early (even in the draw phase), especially if you go first\r\nOnly consideration is cosmic Cyclone etc being able to pick out your other backrow that can't be used esrly\r\n4) GeargiaArsenal is a great way to ditch a monster in the grave for powerful Rebirth\r\nIt puts pressure to have 2-3 Mons out by your second turn without ties, and can often force a surrender","main0":"Geargiattacker","main1":"Geargiattacker","main2":"Geargianchor","main3":"Geargianchor","main4":"Geargianchor","main5":"Geargiarsenal","main6":"Geargiarsenal","main7":"Geargiarsenal","main8":"Forbidden Chalice","main9":"Forbidden Chalice","main10":"Ties of the Brethren","main11":"Ties of the Brethren","main12":"Curse of Anubis","main13":"Paleozoic Canadia","main14":"Powerful Rebirth","main15":"Powerful Rebirth","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Pulse Mines","main18":"Pulse Mines","main19":"Pulse Mines","date":"2018-04-09T20:20:36.868Z"}
