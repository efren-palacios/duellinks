But then I realize this deck has more potential when eclipse wyvern is realise. \r\n\r\nSince I faced alot of CA players , the main play of this deck was econ take there saffira then dragons rebirth it..\r\n\r\nAlso getting felgrand on the field with over 4k attack is hard for ca to deal with . Especially if u have back row .\r\n\r\nAlso vs water. Once u get arkbrave on to the field its gg. Cause once you banish there ssa an field spells. It's hard for them to respond.\r\n\r\nP.s this deck is trash so don't play it.","main0":"Felgrand Dragon","main1":"Arkbrave Dragon","main2":"Arkbrave Dragon","main3":"Dragon Knight of Creation","main4":"Dragon Knight of Creation","main5":"Paladin of Felgrand","main6":"Paladin of Felgrand","main7":"Paladin of Felgrand","main8":"Guardian of Felgrand","main9":"Guardian of Felgrand","main10":"Card Breaker","main11":"Card Breaker","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Dragon's Rebirth","main16":"Dragon's Rebirth","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Powerful Rebirth","main19":"Wall of Disruption","main20":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-04-04T00:34:49.054Z"}
