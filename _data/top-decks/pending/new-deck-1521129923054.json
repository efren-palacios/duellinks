I ignored the last 3 boxes, saw sylvans in the latest box, and just knew that these cards were calling to me to play them! \r\nTried dinos to get from legend 1 to 3, deranked to 1, used hazy beatdown to rerank back to 3, then I swapped to sylvans when I was on the legend 3 derank match.\r\nI haven't practiced sylvans before going into ranked, however, after many misplays by me and my opponents (shout outs to the guy who turn 1 cc'd their own floodgate lol), I won my first 5 matches to kog regardless , Basic strategy is shroom for mill, pop effects, econ take for profit, and rely on the World Carrotweight Champion to carry to victory. Three econs are very valuable, specifically for econ takes. Carrot is the big mvp to help otk. I haven't used either jar or providence in any of those 5 matches, but they are helpful to get back cards into the deck and negate cards that threaten sylvans. Even though sylvans are quite new, they are quite fun to play and deserve their moment to shine.","main0":"Sylvan Hermitree","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Hermitree","main3":"Sylvan Guardioak","main4":"World Carrotweight Champion","main5":"Sylvan Flowerknight","main6":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main7":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main8":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main9":"Rose Lover","main10":"Rose Lover","main11":"Rose Lover","main12":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main13":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main14":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Enemy Controller","main18":"Jar of Avarice","main19":"Ultimate Providence","date":"2018-03-15T16:05:23.054Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
