The deck has a learning curve, took me around 40 wins with this deck to get there . Lyla works surprisingly well and Monster Gate can win you games on it's own, it's not uncommon to mill 15 cards even if you don't open with Grass.","main0":"Dark Magician of Chaos","main1":"Prophecy Destroyer","main2":"Prophecy Destroyer","main3":"Reaper of Prophecy","main4":"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress","main5":"Fool of Prophecy","main6":"Fool of Prophecy","main7":"Fool of Prophecy","main8":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main9":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main10":"Monster Gate","main11":"Spellbook Library of the Crescent","main12":"Spellbook Organization","main13":"Spellbook of Eternity","main14":"Spellbook of Eternity","main15":"Spellbook of Eternity","main16":"Spellbook of Fate","main17":"Spellbook of Fate","main18":"Spellbook of Fate","main19":"Spellbook of Power","main20":"Spellbook of Secrets","main21":"Spellbook of Secrets","main22":"Spellbook of Secrets","main23":"Spellbook of the Master","main24":"Spellbook of the Master","main25":"That Grass Looks Greener","main26":"That Grass Looks Greener","main27":"That Grass Looks Greener","main28":"That Grass Looks Greener","main29":"Treacherous Trap Hole","timestamp":1527206719,"date":"2018-05-25T00:05:19.154Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
