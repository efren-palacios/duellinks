This deck crushes everything but Sylvans, but I guess it has a fighting chance against them too.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I would change anything, this list is basically optimal imo. A 3rd ties would be good, but the only thing I'd drop for it would be either Chalice (which clutched out many games) or an attacker (which I find 2 is the sweetspot in running, since 3 = dead hands)","main0":"Geargiattacker","main1":"Geargiattacker","main2":"Geargianchor","main3":"Geargianchor","main4":"Geargianchor","main5":"Geargiarsenal","main6":"Geargiarsenal","main7":"Geargiaccelerator","main8":"Enemy Controller","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Forbidden Chalice","main12":"Ties of the Brethren","main13":"Ties of the Brethren","main14":"Powerful Rebirth","main15":"Powerful Rebirth","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Pulse Mines","main18":"Pulse Mines","main19":"Pulse Mines","extra0":"Five-Headed Dragon","extra1":"Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem","extra2":"Sky Galloping Gaia the Dragon Champion","extra3":"Gem-Knight Prismaura","extra4":"Pair Cycroid","date":"2018-04-15T04:55:31.757Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
