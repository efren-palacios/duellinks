Finally did it on the 43th win.\r\nThe deck have some potential, but there are 2 big problems: Divine Wrath and the fact that people can't read the cards. I won some games just because my opponent thought they could just do Whale on Geargianchor. \r\nThat wont last long.\r\nBtw, I'm gonna play it tomorrow on my stream :^)","main0":"Geargiattacker","main1":"Geargiattacker","main2":"Geargianchor","main3":"Geargianchor","main4":"Geargiarsenal","main5":"Geargiarsenal","main6":"Geargiarsenal","main7":"Geargiaccelerator","main8":"Geargiaccelerator","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Forbidden Chalice","main13":"Forbidden Chalice","main14":"Curse of Anubis","main15":"Powerful Rebirth","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Pulse Mines","main18":"Pulse Mines","main19":"Pulse Mines","date":"2018-04-04T00:21:52.945Z"}
