My losses were either misplays on me due to fatigue or komoney giving me  bricks or my enemy god hands. I won every matchup even in the hardest circumstances. I had 3 matches in a row vs magnets where they got turn 1 valk and stuff through grass and I won. I beat ca , aliens , magnets, phoenix , archfiends ,water  , dinos , and other shit on the ladder very hard. Surprised how badly people play around wod right now while during the kc cup I felt like people played around it much better. Nonetheless wod/impen is a meta call and dependent on if you face good or bad players. 2 dimi with srh is a superior set up than 2 murmillo as he is not worth running cause bricks. Also the 6-6 balance of backrow gives you far less bricks. Cosmic has won me multiple games solo and so has wind/curse/econ . Srh is the most consistent off them though as it will always give you some value pretty much. Floodgate will either win you or lose games so I ran 2 not 3 as it is way too polar. Anyhow I played a more aggro glad beast style and didn't sit around and wait. Pm me any questions and I'll be glad to help cause it's 1 am rn and very ecstatic lol.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Cosmic Cyclone","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Super Rush Headlong","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Curse of Anubis","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Wall of Disruption","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Windstorm of Etaqua","extra0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","extra1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","extra2":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","date":"2018-03-03T23:37:29.013Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
