I'm not skilled enough to play sylvans or geargia so had to resort to this. Great matchup vs sylvans. Masked heroes and geargia is back and forth. Could potentially be great with the Ishizu skull servant skill to prevent rose lover plays and to stop celestial from drawing 2 and archfiends.","main0":"Destructotron","main1":"Reinforced Human Psychic Borg","main2":"Reinforced Human Psychic Borg","main3":"Reinforced Human Psychic Borg","main4":"Serene Psychic Witch","main5":"Serene Psychic Witch","main6":"Serene Psychic Witch","main7":"Power Injector","main8":"Power Injector","main9":"Sphere Kuriboh","main10":"Sphere Kuriboh","main11":"Sphere Kuriboh","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Psychokinesis","main15":"Psychokinesis","main16":"Psychokinesis","main17":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main18":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main19":"Floodgate Trap Hole","date":"2018-04-22T16:22:14.496Z"}
