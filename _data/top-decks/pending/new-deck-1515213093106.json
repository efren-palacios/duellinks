I tried to stay in legend to test a lot of builds but the ladder is garbage rn and will still until day 24 and the bamboo banlist. So thatâ€™s all, unfortunately only really tested mindscan x shadow game, still in love with mind scan and probably will still playing it after the nerf.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Enemy Controller","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Curse of Anubis","main12":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main13":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Impenetrable Attack","main16":"Impenetrable Attack","main17":"Wall of Disruption","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Windstorm of Etaqua","date":"2018-01-06T04:31:33.105Z"}
