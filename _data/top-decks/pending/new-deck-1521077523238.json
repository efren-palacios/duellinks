Here's the link to his decklist and in-depth write-up: https://www.reddit.com/r/DuelLinks/comments/83bwtt/deck_kog_alien_infestation_a_different_take_on/\r\n\r\nPretty swift climb (by my humble standards). Took 88 wins to get kog and only got dropped out of rank-up once due to bricking. \r\n\r\nThe main advantage of this deck is not the parasites that are put in your opponents deck but the mind games you're playing on them. Parasite only showed in like 5 games out of 30 and not even once during my final matchups. The idea behind this deck is to go aggressive for fast wins. Only losses I've had were the ones where RNGesus decided to be a troll and gave me enough bricks to build a house.\r\n\r\nOnly changes I've made to the deck was one Gyokkou over second cyclone (yeah I'm poor) and ditched one brain control aka the main brick of the deck.\r\n\r\nI used Mind-Scan fishes first to get out of plat. Way too much random crap for my taste. I went to legend 2. Then I shifted to the alien build once I noticed that the amount of trolls in legend had miraculously decreased.","main0":"Alien Overlord","main1":"Alien Overlord","main2":"Alien Warrior","main3":"Alien Warrior","main4":"Alien Warrior","main5":"Alien Telepath","main6":"Alien Telepath","main7":"Alien Telepath","main8":"Alien Grey","main9":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main10":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main11":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main12":"Cosmic Cyclone","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Fire Formation - Gyokkou","main16":"Jade Insect Whistle","main17":"Mysterious Triangle","main18":"Mysterious Triangle","main19":"Brainwashing Beam","date":"2018-03-15T01:32:03.238Z"}
