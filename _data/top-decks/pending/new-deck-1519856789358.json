My conclusion to all this testing is that Aliens are a great option for new players and veterans to pick up and play. The deck has a lot of favourable matchups, and only really loses to Hazy (who plays that anymore, right?) and burn (which i tend to just surrender turn 2-3 to save time). Lots of options with this list. Went with the 2 e-cons to allow for tribute take plays -> powerful rebirth my tributed monster; won so many games with that combo. Anubis over wall of D/Windstorm as it keeps enemy monsters stuck in defence if it gets CC'd. Also a good chainable stall card in general.","main0":"Alien Overlord","main1":"Alien Warrior","main2":"Alien Warrior","main3":"Alien Warrior","main4":"Alien Telepath","main5":"Alien Telepath","main6":"Alien Telepath","main7":"Alien Grey","main8":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main9":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main10":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Mysterious Triangle","main14":"Brainwashing Beam","main15":"Brainwashing Beam","main16":"Curse of Anubis","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Powerful Rebirth","main19":"Powerful Rebirth","date":"2018-02-28T22:26:29.358Z","layout":"post"}
