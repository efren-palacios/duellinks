Just sitting on a whale (without ALO) or Abyss was enough to buy me time to set up or play the beatdown. Cloudian engine over hammer shark or gishki because it didn’t require my hand to have a specific monster and brings out fodder for whale turn 1. Econ/Anubis was mostly for def if they baited my banish. Anubis over 2nd econ for Whale mirror, Hazy, and to prevent otks. CC for cancer decks. Found the ratios great.","main0":"Citadel Whale","main1":"Citadel Whale","main2":"Citadel Whale","main3":"Warrior of Atlantis","main4":"Warrior of Atlantis","main5":"Abyss Soldier","main6":"Abyss Soldier","main7":"Cloudian - Turbulence","main8":"Cloudian - Turbulence","main9":"Cloudian - Turbulence","main10":"Fishborg Planter","main11":"Fishborg Planter","main12":"Cloudian - Smoke Ball","main13":"A Legendary Ocean","main14":"A Legendary Ocean","main15":"Cosmic Cyclone","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Curse of Anubis","main18":"Sea Stealth Attack","main19":"Sea Stealth Attack","date":"2018-03-18T20:13:33.144Z"}
