Quote me on this” -ShinySopheon\r\n\r\nHighly recommend a Divine Wrath tech because it’s pretty devastating to most every other meta deck, especially if you can draw it early. \r\nI’m torn on Heavy Knight vs Wyvern but Knight’s 2000 attack with wasteland was useful sometimes. \r\nI still like econs in REZ as long as cyber angels are on the ladder and possibly even after since econ take is a much safer play after you’ce cleared their backrow and it can help win games when you don’t have a monster that’s able to get over your opponent’s.","main0":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main1":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main2":"Heavy Knight of the Flame","main3":"Gozuki","main4":"Gozuki","main5":"Samurai Skull","main6":"Samurai Skull","main7":"Samurai Skull","main8":"Bacon Saver","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Red-Eyes Insight","main12":"Red-Eyes Insight","main13":"Storm","main14":"Storm","main15":"Curse of Anubis","main16":"Divine Wrath","main17":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main18":"Red-Eyes Spirit","main19":"Red-Eyes Spirit","date":"2018-01-06T02:03:38.381Z"}
