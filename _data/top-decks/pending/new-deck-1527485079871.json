Luckily my boys, the Six Samurais who came to my aide. Got a fast 37 game KoG with a 20-2 record.\r\n\r\nThe deck has a lot going for it (copied @Whybona 's list straight up). \r\n- Spot monster removal (via Hand)\r\n- Board swarm (Grandmaster + Shogun)\r\n- Targeted removal protection from GY  (Doji and Kizaru)\r\n- Deck thinning (Doji + Kizaru)\r\n- S+T lockdown (Shogun)\r\n\r\nThe choice of backrow is SRH for Amazons and having good synergy with the deck overall, e-con because we are ok with e-con take plays due to 3 powerful rebirths.\r\n\r\nRihan is in the deck as an option, but I didn't fuse into it once in my KoG push.\r\n\r\nWhat could potentially push this deck to TOP tier is the decks main draw engine \"Six Samurai United\" so keep an eye out for that in any upcoming events/boxes.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you are looking for a fun deck to flood the board and pull off  crazy OTK's look no further than Six Samurais.","main0":"Great Shogun Shien","main1":"Great Shogun Shien","main2":"Grandmaster of the Six Samurai","main3":"Grandmaster of the Six Samurai","main4":"Grandmaster of the Six Samurai","main5":"Secret Six Samurai - Kizaru","main6":"Secret Six Samurai - Kizaru","main7":"Secret Six Samurai - Doji","main8":"Secret Six Samurai - Doji","main9":"Secret Six Samurai - Doji","main10":"Hand of the Six Samurai","main11":"Hand of the Six Samurai","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Super Rush Headlong","main15":"Super Rush Headlong","main16":"Super Rush Headlong","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Powerful Rebirth","main19":"Powerful Rebirth","date":"2018-05-28T05:24:39.871Z","tags":["comment-subscription"],"timestamp":1527485079,"layout":"post","message":" "}
