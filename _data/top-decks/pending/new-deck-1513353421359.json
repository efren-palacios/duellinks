Basically switch all their monsters to defense and you can whack the heck out of 'em thanks to holy guard. triple-econ and triple-floodgate are so good against CA and ninjas.\r\n\r\nNerokius is my favorite for fusion cause he can secure some games. Im using triple Murmillo because he's the mvp of the deck.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main9":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Curse of Anubis","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Mirror Wall","main19":"Windstorm of Etaqua","date":"2017-12-15T15:57:01.359Z","timestamp":1513353421}
