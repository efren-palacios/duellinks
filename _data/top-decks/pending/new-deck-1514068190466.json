Managed to get some OTKs against ninjas when going second with temple and inaba/skystarray combo. 3 inabas instead of skystarray to prevent getting blocked by econ/sk which is pretty common in today's meta. One aegis to deal with the occassional weevil burn encountered on my climb.","main0":"Lava Golem","main1":"Skystarray","main2":"Inaba White Rabbit","main3":"Inaba White Rabbit","main4":"Inaba White Rabbit","main5":"Temple of the Mind's Eye","main6":"Temple of the Mind's Eye","main7":"Temple of the Mind's Eye","main8":"Aegis of Gaia","main9":"Draining Shield","main10":"Draining Shield","main11":"Draining Shield","main12":"Enchanted Javelin","main13":"Enchanted Javelin","main14":"Enchanted Javelin","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main18":"Massivemorph","main19":"Massivemorph","main20":"Massivemorph","date":"2017-12-23T22:29:50.466Z"}
