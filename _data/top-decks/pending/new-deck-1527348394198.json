I dropped myself to legend 1, and ran it straight to Kog. Only lost a couple of matches.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to expand upon this a little more. During my climb I didn't face any spellbooks, I know the hot meme is that they are the hardest matchup for this deck. I faced a bunch of sylvans, amazons, and heroes. Most of those are cakewalks, heroes can be monka-esque if they can dodge the combo of drystan and offerings/tth.","main0":"Noble Knight Drystan","main1":"Noble Knight Drystan","main2":"Noble Knight Drystan","main3":"Noble Knight Medraut","main4":"Noble Knight Medraut","main5":"Noble Knight Medraut","main6":"Noble Knight Bedwyr","main7":"Noble Knight Bedwyr","main8":"Double Cyclone","main9":"Double Cyclone","main10":"Glory of the Noble Knights","main11":"Glory of the Noble Knights","main12":"Glory of the Noble Knights","main13":"Noble Arms - Arfeudutyr","main14":"Noble Arms - Arfeudutyr","main15":"Noble Arms - Gallatin","main16":"Noble Arms of Destiny","main17":"Noble Arms of Destiny","main18":"Offerings to the Doomed","main19":"Treacherous Trap Hole","date":"2018-05-26T15:26:34.198Z","timestamp":1527348394,"tags":["comment-subscription"]}
