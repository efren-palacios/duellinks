It allowed me to grab resources when I was low. This deck does well against CA REZD and Ninjas. Hazy was a difficult mu. Mind scan combos well with BigCD because then I know wether or not I can attack with my glads and still play BigCD in the same turn. The major weakness of this deck is not drawing a monster in your first 2-3 turns; Happened far less often than expected.\r\nI also believe you could probably sub out half shuts for Impenetrable Attack if you donâ€™t have them but HS is better","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main6":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main7":"Enemy Controller","main8":"Enemy Controller","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Forbidden Chalice","main11":"Forbidden Chalice","main12":"Half Shut","main13":"Half Shut","main14":"Half Shut","main15":"The Big Cattle Drive","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main18":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main19":"Impenetrable Attack","date":"2017-12-17T06:10:54.924Z"}
