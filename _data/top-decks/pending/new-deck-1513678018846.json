I just got tired of seeing Burn.\r\nAnyways Fenghuang was a surprisingly decent tech since it can wipe out the entire backrow, and it also bounces back so you don't have to worry about Lava Golem.\r\n\r\nAlso my KoG rank up duel was literally someone scooping after they saw that they were using Odion without his Skill.\r\n\r\nI don't think Cosmic Cyclone was that relevant in my duels, accept for one when I got rid of someone's Mausoleum after the payed the cost and someone who was using Toon World, so feel free to replace it with Big Cattle Drive.","main0":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main1":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main2":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main3":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main4":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main5":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main6":"Flame Tiger","main7":"Hazy Flame Peryton","main8":"Caninetaur","main9":"Caninetaur","main10":"Fenghuang","main11":"Cosmic Cyclone","main12":"Soul Exchange","main13":"Soul Exchange","main14":"Beast Rising","main15":"Beast Rising","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main18":"Hazy Glory","main19":"Mirror Wall","date":"2017-12-19T10:06:58.845Z","timestamp":1513678018}
