Opponents often attacked set GB which can be game winning.\r\n- skip opponents draw phase can be huge \r\n- parasite is a great attack target even for murmillo\r\n- forces a face up monster on opponents side. Makes e-con take with golem easy\r\n- reduces tea burn consistency by making deck 21/22 cards\r\n-1000 damage can win games.\r\n\r\nDownside of weevil:\r\n- lower starting hand consistency vs balance but I only bricked twice. GB has good brick recovery.\r\n- not as much burn potential as shadow game\r\n- harder to play around back row without minds can but not an issue if you note prompts.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Enemy Controller","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Super Rush Headlong","main12":"Curse of Anubis","main13":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Impenetrable Attack","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Windstorm of Etaqua","extra0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","extra1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","extra2":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","date":"2018-01-09T00:15:16.102Z"}
