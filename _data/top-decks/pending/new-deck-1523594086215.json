{"_id":"fe294820-3ed3-11e8-851c-412bcd45ac86","name":"Face Transplant","deckType":"masked-heroes","skill":"Restart","author":"Popcorn","notes":"Can easily thin your deck down to 10 in one turn, have Dangerous out with a Malicious, and 2 face downs.\r\nYou wanna dump a Celeste, get your draw power going, fish for your CC, FC and Mask Change. Bait out their backrow if you can then Mask Change.\r\n(Powerful Rebirth and DDraw can probably get swapped out, but I like 'em for some reason... Rebirth lets you pop Vylon again to dump another Hero, or you can bring out Decider with it and pop it's effect to recover something, and then discard it with Dangerous to dump another D Hero.)\r\nRestart is the way to play. I really love the way you can set up in different ways in anticipation of what your opponent might be playing.\r\nI see some people putting Drilldark in their decks... I don't understand why they think it's a good monster.\r\nThis deck is all about thinning down to get to your power Spells, and Drilldark doesn't do anything to contribute. He needs to get a job, move out, and stop leaching off of his parents.","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main4":"Vision HERO Vyon","main5":"Vision HERO Vyon","main6":"Vision HERO Vyon","main7":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main8":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main9":"Destiny HERO - Dreamer","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Cosmic Cyclone","main12":"Destiny Draw","main13":"Forbidden Chalice","main14":"Forbidden Chalice","main15":"Mask Change","main16":"Mask Change","main17":"Mask Change","main18":"Polymerization","main19":"Powerful Rebirth","extra0":"Masked HERO Anki","extra1":"Masked HERO Anki","extra2":"Masked HERO Anki","extra3":"Vision HERO Trinity","extra4":"Destiny HERO - Dangerous","date":"2018-04-13T04:34:46.215Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
