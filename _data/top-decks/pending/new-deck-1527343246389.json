Was working with an 8 monster variant, but cutting them for econs made a big difference. A third Drystan will make your life a lot easier, but I only had 2 to work with. Got lucky with my Medraut pulls. All you need in hand is a monster, quick play, and equip spell. Only use the equips you need to avoid clogging your backrow and stay on top of your toggle plays.","main0":"Noble Knight Drystan","main1":"Noble Knight Drystan","main2":"Noble Knight Medraut","main3":"Noble Knight Medraut","main4":"Noble Knight Medraut","main5":"Noble Knight Bedwyr","main6":"Double Cyclone","main7":"Double Cyclone","main8":"Enemy Controller","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Glory of the Noble Knights","main11":"Glory of the Noble Knights","main12":"Glory of the Noble Knights","main13":"Noble Arms - Arfeudutyr","main14":"Noble Arms - Arfeudutyr","main15":"Noble Arms - Caliburn","main16":"Noble Arms - Gallatin","main17":"Noble Arms - Gallatin","main18":"Noble Arms - Gallatin","main19":"Treacherous Trap Hole","date":"2018-05-26T14:00:46.388Z","timestamp":1527343246,"tags":["comment-subscription"]}
