Ancient Gears are horrible rn and REZ kept bricking so figured, might as well run bootleg Glads and see if it works. I scrolled through this thread seeing other glad players and saw another player play them alongside weevil parasites. I thought that was pretty cool and I've got to admit, it worked very well (granted its late season). 4-star Ladybug was the MVP against snipe hunter volcanics, ancient gears and whoever  thought it's a good ideal to run srgt electro. The parasites were clutch in whittling down the HP and while i've never been a huge fan of Cosmic Cyclone, I am now.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"4-Starred Ladybug of Doom","main6":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Sphere Kuriboh","main9":"Sphere Kuriboh","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Impenetrable Attack","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","extra0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","extra1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","extra2":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","extra3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","date":"2018-02-28T20:45:01.585Z","layout":"post"}
