If you open optimally then you will always have a fusion play and will always be able to maintain at least 3 cards in hand\r\nIf you don’t open poly then the majority of the time you can just play Volcanics, which is why this deck had so much success.\r\nBeatdown was 100% necessary in this meta; if it wasn’t then I would easily play either restart or duel standby and I guarantee this would open well almost 100% of the time. With those 2 skills you could probably run defensive cards as well\r\nBrick hands are: opening all gem-knights or opening both BA and poly\r\nOr somehow opening 1 garnet 1 tourmaline and 1 painful","main0":"Volcanic Rocket","main1":"Volcanic Rocket","main2":"Volcanic Rocket","main3":"Royal Firestorm Guards","main4":"Gem-Knight Lazuli","main5":"Gem-Knight Lazuli","main6":"Gem-Knight Lazuli","main7":"Volcanic Shell","main8":"Volcanic Shell","main9":"Volcanic Shell","main10":"Gem-Knight Garnet","main11":"Gem-Knight Garnet","main12":"Gem-Knight Tourmaline","main13":"Gem-Knight Tourmaline","main14":"Blaze Accelerator","main15":"Fusion Recycling Plant","main16":"Fusion Recycling Plant","main17":"Fusion Recycling Plant","main18":"Painful Decision","main19":"Polymerization","extra0":"Gem-Knight Prismaura","extra1":"Gem-Knight Citrine","extra2":"Gem-Knight Citrine","extra3":"Gem-Knight Citrine","extra4":"Gem-Knight Topaz","date":"2018-02-09T23:41:30.263Z","layout":"post","message":" ","timestamp":1518219690,"tags":["user-generated"]}
