The flying fish + oyster combo is a very strong 1 for 2 play, couple that with powerful rebirth and you can pop 4 of your opponents cards with that combo. Core of the deck is 3x flying fish, 3x oyster and 3x rebirth with tuna and depth charge being great support cards. I opted for 3x super rush instead of econ because I was facing a lot of whale decks. Main weakness of this deck is consistency, there was more than a few games where I opened all monsters but that is to be expected with the 10 monster lineup in the deck.\r\n\r\nPs: hammer shark isn't really essential to the deck and could be replaced with other fish type monsters in the future but it's the best we have for right now.","main0":"Golden Flying Fish","main1":"Golden Flying Fish","main2":"Golden Flying Fish","main3":"Hammer Shark","main4":"Hammer Shark","main5":"Hammer Shark","main6":"Oyster Meister","main7":"Oyster Meister","main8":"Oyster Meister","main9":"Beautunaful Princess","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Super Rush Headlong","main12":"Super Rush Headlong","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Fish Depth Charge","main15":"Powerful Rebirth","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-03-07T14:12:29.894Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
