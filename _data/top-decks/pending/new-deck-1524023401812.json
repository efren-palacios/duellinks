My rank up gems actually got me my 3rd Anki which was great. \r\nI also played this deck in the KC Cup and though I couldn't play as much as I'd like to have due to work, this deck allowed me to rank higher than I ever had, reaching around 20k at my highest.\r\nThe reason I love this deck is due to it's similar play style to 3SD Ninjas, which was my prior favorite deck. It's extremely powerful with a wide range of plays that you can make, with you being able to make multiple plays per turn. Each card holds lots of value. \r\nTook a few games to get the hang of the deck down, but once I had it down it was an easy 5 games.","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main4":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main5":"Vision HERO Vyon","main6":"Vision HERO Vyon","main7":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main8":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main9":"Destiny HERO - Dreamer","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Forbidden Chalice","main15":"Mask Change","main16":"Mask Change","main17":"Mask Change","main18":"Polymerization","main19":"Polymerization","extra0":"Masked HERO Anki","extra1":"Masked HERO Anki","extra2":"Vision HERO Trinity","extra3":"Destiny HERO - Dangerous","extra4":"Destiny HERO - Dangerous","date":"2018-04-18T03:50:01.812Z","timestamp":1524023401}
