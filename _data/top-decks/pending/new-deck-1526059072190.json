This deck will remain relevant on the ladder as long as Sylvans are popular. It seems like a lot of Amazoness decks are also dropping ECon for Chalice and SRH due to the mirror, making them more manageable for CA.\r\n\r\nTreacherous Trap Hole (TTH) is pretty clutch vs. Amazoness, Heroes, and overall in general. I had one game where I managed to chain 2 TTHs vs. an Amazoness deck and wiped their entire frontrow.\r\n\r\nUse Alexis and prismatic Dakini + MAAR for good luck\r\n\r\n#CAisdead #freedakini #natashawhen","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main2":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main3":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Benten","main7":"Gishki Chain","main8":"Gishki Chain","main9":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main10":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main11":"Cyber Petit Angel","main12":"Hymn of Light","main13":"Hymn of Light","main14":"Hymn of Light","main15":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main16":"Machine Angel Ritual","main17":"Sprite's Blessing","main18":"Treacherous Trap Hole","main19":"Treacherous Trap Hole","date":"2018-05-11T17:17:52.190Z"}
