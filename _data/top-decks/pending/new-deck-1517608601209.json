Do not go all in with Dakini unless you're at least 90% sure you can win on that turn. Most of the times, setting up a follow up play with Saffira is much more valuable.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main2":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main3":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Benten","main7":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main10":"Cyber Petit Angel","main11":"Cyber Petit Angel","main12":"Fenghuang","main13":"Hymn of Light","main14":"Hymn of Light","main15":"Hymn of Light","main16":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main17":"Machine Angel Ritual","main18":"Sprite's Blessing","main19":"Sprite's Blessing","date":"2018-02-02T21:56:41.209Z","commentDate":"2018-02-02T21:56:41.209Z","timestamp":1517608601,"layout":"post"}
