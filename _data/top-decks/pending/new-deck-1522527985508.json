Its true that the 200 Atk boost didnt help be beat over anything in particular, though it does allow the Oyster token to be used offensively; which i needed to otk a fair few times. \r\n\r\nMind scan i suppose allows you to hit troublesome cards hidden amongst full backrow but never did i kick myself over it, instead wiping the whole field with tokens and rebirths. i need to test the mindscan variant myself before making an informed decision, feels unneeded; but i did go up against many decks also using the yami skill.. making that a bit redundant too\r\n\r\nGood Deck! at any rate, only 32 wins from Plat 4","main0":"Golden Flying Fish","main1":"Golden Flying Fish","main2":"Golden Flying Fish","main3":"Hammer Shark","main4":"Hammer Shark","main5":"Hammer Shark","main6":"Oyster Meister","main7":"Oyster Meister","main8":"Oyster Meister","main9":"Beautunaful Princess","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Super Rush Headlong","main15":"Fish Depth Charge","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-03-31T20:26:25.508Z"}
