Since stall is making it's way back somewhat, came up with a list that did not use ojama go. Feel like the extra card advantage is worth more. Deck has no draw power besides the skill, but stall never relied on draw power. \r\n\r\n1 lava golem suffices since goal is to clog the field & i feel like lava is just another win condition. doomsday is good as it protects for a turn and it's a quickplay. Needle ceiling works with doomsday or setting a kuriboh/dog. original kuriboh over sphere since if you don't have needle ceiling they can econ after in battle step if you massive morphed their monster. \r\n\r\npretty easy vs spellbooks & amazoness even if they use princess second effect. since most of the cards clog the field or remove all their monsters . sylvans is 50-50 but doomsday comes in clutch in case they have providence set. did not face any geargia at all nor archfiends. mask heroes can be tough since they run quite a few backrow removal. \r\n\r\nnot sure how this deck would fare in a tournament setting as d wrath/ultimate prov would mess your win condition but you can always side for that. problem is if people side in heavy backrow removal again.","main0":"Lava Golem","main1":"Kuriboh","main2":"Kuriboh","main3":"Outstanding Dog Marron","main4":"Golden Ladybug","main5":"Golden Ladybug","main6":"Golden Ladybug","main7":"Fires of Doomsday","main8":"Fires of Doomsday","main9":"Fires of Doomsday","main10":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main11":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main12":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main13":"Massivemorph","main14":"Massivemorph","main15":"Massivemorph","main16":"Needle Ceiling","main17":"Needle Ceiling","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-05-09T05:24:39.514Z","timestamp":1525843479}
