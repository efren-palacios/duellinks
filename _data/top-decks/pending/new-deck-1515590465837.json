I am not a fan of 3 Chiron though. He rarely gets value. So I added 2 Parallel Twister and Topaz Tiger. They put in a lot of work. Gives you a way to deal with Beast Rising consistently, and a ton more removal for Glad's monsters. This deck really only had a hard time with Pre Nerf CA and Ninjas on my climb.\r\none of the Parallel Twisters can become whatever you like though.
