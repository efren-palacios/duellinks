I think it is at least tier 2.5 or 2 cuz i destroyed almost every tier 2/3 deck like AG, glads, dinos ect. Hardest match ups  were CA cuz they drew like gods and hazy, but only if i couldn't clear beast rising, same weakness as 3sd ninjas","main0":"Black Dragon Ninja","main1":"Black Dragon Ninja","main2":"Red Dragon Ninja","main3":"Red Dragon Ninja","main4":"Senior Silver Ninja","main5":"Flame Armor Ninja","main6":"Flame Armor Ninja","main7":"Earth Armor Ninja","main8":"Earth Armor Ninja","main9":"Masked Ninja Ebisu","main10":"Masked Ninja Ebisu","main11":"Crimson Ninja","main12":"Armor Ninjitsu Art of Alchemy","main13":"Ninjitsu Art Notebook","main14":"Ninjitsu Art Notebook","main15":"Ninjitsu Art of Duplication","main16":"Ninjitsu Art of Duplication","main17":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","main18":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","main19":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","date":"2018-01-16T18:13:38.180Z","timestamp":1516126418}
