Was grinding Mai :Kappa~5: up to lv 45 on the walks home thinking once I get queen I’ll rush kog but I had trouble with the mirror and playing optimally so only made to legend 1. Got legend 2 with geargias but they started to fall off so switched to heroes and rushed in about an hour. 54 wins ain’t bad.","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main4":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main5":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main6":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main7":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main8":"Cosmic Cyclone","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Forbidden Chalice","main14":"Forbidden Chalice","main15":"Forbidden Chalice","main16":"Mask Change","main17":"Mask Change","main18":"Mask Change","main19":"Treacherous Trap Hole","extra0":"Masked HERO Anki","extra1":"Masked HERO Anki","extra2":"Masked HERO Anki","extra3":"Vision HERO Trinity","extra4":"Destiny HERO - Dangerous","date":"2018-05-14T14:57:24.257Z"}
