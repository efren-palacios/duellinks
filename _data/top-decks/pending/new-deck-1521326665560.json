I feel that for this deck, itâ€™s ok if it exceeds the 20 cards. Especially to avoid merchant betray! Thinking about adding a second carrot as well as a second oak, maybe cutting hermitree and trunade. Still a long way to go to find the most optimal/most consistent variant.","main0":"Sylvan Hermitree","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Hermitree","main3":"Sylvan Guardioak","main4":"World Carrotweight Champion","main5":"Sylvan Flowerknight","main6":"Sylvan Flowerknight","main7":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main8":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main9":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main10":"Rose Lover","main11":"Rose Lover","main12":"Rose Lover","main13":"Magical Merchant","main14":"Magical Merchant","main15":"Magical Merchant","main16":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main17":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main18":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main19":"Raging Mad Plants","main20":"Raging Mad Plants","main21":"Hey, Trunade!","date":"2018-03-17T22:44:25.560Z"}
