Shien lets you beat over big monsters without Beast Rising and can be used as a decent turn 1 stun option while also being a level 7 fire. Sphere Kuriboh adds defensive utility without messing up the monster count. E-Con is kinda mandatory currently. Manticore lets us go +3 turn 1 with Cattle Drive/Peryton plays and also plays around Super Rush. Flame Tiger over Soul Exchange for general utility in recovery plays and being able to bait out Floodgate.","main0":"Great Shogun Shien","main1":"Hazy Flame Mantikor","main2":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main3":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main4":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main5":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main6":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main7":"Flame Tiger","main8":"Flame Tiger","main9":"Flame Tiger","main10":"Hazy Flame Peryton","main11":"Hazy Flame Peryton","main12":"Hazy Flame Peryton","main13":"Sphere Kuriboh","main14":"Sphere Kuriboh","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"The Big Cattle Drive","main18":"Beast Rising","main19":"Beast Rising","date":"2017-12-17T02:31:14.668Z"}
