Pretty easy climb this month, only 35 wins. Beat 4 Sylvan's and Relinquished during the KoG run. Sangan is definitely just a fun tech choice. Capable of some solid plays, but don't know if it fits for sure. Getting to send it from field to leave with Princess though feels brutal in the mirror.","main0":"Amazoness Queen","main1":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main2":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main3":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main4":"Amazoness Sage","main5":"Amazoness Princess","main6":"Amazoness Princess","main7":"Amazoness Princess","main8":"Sangan","main9":"Amazoness Baby Tiger","main10":"Amazoness Baby Tiger","main11":"Cosmic Cyclone","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Offerings to the Doomed","main14":"Offerings to the Doomed","main15":"Amazoness Onslaught","main16":"Amazoness Onslaught","main17":"Amazoness Onslaught","main18":"Amazoness Willpower","main19":"Amazoness Willpower","date":"2018-05-16T17:30:17.759Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
