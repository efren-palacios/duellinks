Had to run 3 chalice in my fishes and aliens decks just for the annoying sylvans. Then I lost my patience and switched to sylvans myself.\r\nI feel like 3 S/Ts are enough. 5 is too much for me. Milling S/Ts is a huge waste. The skill is restart. I usually use restart to search for a S/T. All the three S/Ts can send carrot/rose to GY, which is super useful.","main0":"Sylvan Hermitree","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Hermitree","main3":"Sylvan Guardioak","main4":"Sylvan Guardioak","main5":"Sylvan Guardioak","main6":"World Carrotweight Champion","main7":"World Carrotweight Champion","main8":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main9":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main10":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main11":"Rose Lover","main12":"Rose Lover","main13":"Rose Lover","main14":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main15":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main16":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main17":"Enemy Controller","main18":"Tribute to the Doomed","main19":"Divine Wrath","date":"2018-04-07T05:58:51.634Z"}
