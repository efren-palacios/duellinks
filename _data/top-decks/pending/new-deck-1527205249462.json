Ran 2 hole because the cards broken, and typically you only see 1 per duel. Played grit instead of restart because The deck is already consistent enough. Barely lost, Sylvans were easy, fool engine was super powerful, and overall was a very easy kog, no offense to anyone I played against.","main0":"Prophecy Destroyer","main1":"Reaper of Prophecy","main2":"Fool of Prophecy","main3":"Fool of Prophecy","main4":"Fool of Prophecy","main5":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main6":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main7":"Spellbook Library of the Crescent","main8":"Spellbook Organization","main9":"Spellbook of Eternity","main10":"Spellbook of Eternity","main11":"Spellbook of Fate","main12":"Spellbook of Fate","main13":"Spellbook of Fate","main14":"Spellbook of Power","main15":"Spellbook of Secrets","main16":"Spellbook of Secrets","main17":"Spellbook of Secrets","main18":"Spellbook of the Master","main19":"Spellbook of the Master","main20":"Spellbook of the Master","main21":"Treacherous Trap Hole","main22":"Treacherous Trap Hole","timestamp":1527205249,"date":"2018-05-24T23:40:49.461Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
