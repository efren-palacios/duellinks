Lost 6 games total, 3 of them in legend 3.\r\n\r\nOfferings to the Doomed was a 3rd econ thru plat, then a super Rush until legend 3 which helped a lot. Offerings won 3 of the last 5 games. Versatility allowed me to kill lava golems, Amazoness Queens and other problem monsters in awesome ways. May want to play 2 of them.\r\n\r\nTrunade was a second cyclone until legend 3. Everything else is pretty standard.","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main4":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main5":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main6":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main7":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main8":"Cosmic Cyclone","main9":"Destiny Draw","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Forbidden Chalice","main13":"Forbidden Chalice","main14":"Hey, Trunade!","main15":"Mask Change","main16":"Mask Change","main17":"Mask Change","main18":"Offerings to the Doomed","main19":"Treacherous Trap Hole","extra0":"Masked HERO Anki","extra1":"Masked HERO Anki","extra2":"Masked HERO Anki","extra3":"Vision HERO Trinity","extra4":"Destiny HERO - Dangerous","date":"2018-05-14T14:47:30.417Z"}
