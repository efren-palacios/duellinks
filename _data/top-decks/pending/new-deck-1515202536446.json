Climbed from L1-KOG with this deck. Triple ECON did well vs CA and triple floodgate worked very well vs REZ to slow them down and prevent AMA plays, I stopped seeing Hazy so i took out SRH. Cyclone and Gyokkou were my tech cards against Ninja but proved useful in most match-ups.\r\n\r\nShout out to the 2 bamboo players who went 1st and bricked on my 5 game streak to KOG as well as the final boss who chose to surrender turn 1.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Cosmic Cyclone","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Fire Formation - Gyokkou","main13":"Curse of Anubis","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Impenetrable Attack","main19":"Wall of Disruption","extra0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","extra1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","extra2":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","date":"2018-01-06T01:35:36.446Z"}
