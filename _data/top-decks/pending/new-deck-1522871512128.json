This shits just absurdly broken, it has favorable MU against like, every single deck. 36 wins from Plat 4 -> KoG but every single loss aside from 1 was while playing REZ or Sylvan. This deck had 1 loss total in Legend and it was a D-Hero Mirror. Konami got a problem on their hands because these  rough drafts of decks are still so incredibly good\r\nI don't have another Chalice or I'd be running it over a WoD","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main4":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main5":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main6":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main7":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main8":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Forbidden Chalice","main15":"Mask Change","main16":"Mask Change","main17":"Mask Change","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","extra0":"Masked HERO Anki","extra1":"Masked HERO Anki","extra2":"Masked HERO Anki","date":"2018-04-04T19:51:52.127Z","timestamp":1522871512,"layout":"post"}
