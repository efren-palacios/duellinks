I went 15 - 2 only losses were LP0 turn one cyber/king lockout and a very lucky top deck Econ take from a Aromage deck. I played around with a lot of stuff at the beginning of the season to feel out the meta so it took me awhile to get here. The only changes I would make is dropping a Hermitree for another Divine Wrath. Even the one wrath came into play a few times. Oh yeah, Carrot-Econ take-Special summon Carrot is broke.","main0":"Sylvan Hermitree","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Hermitree","main3":"Sylvan Guardioak","main4":"Sylvan Guardioak","main5":"Sylvan Guardioak","main6":"World Carrotweight Champion","main7":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main8":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main9":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main10":"Rose Lover","main11":"Rose Lover","main12":"Rose Lover","main13":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main14":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main15":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Enemy Controller","main18":"Enemy Controller","main19":"Divine Wrath","date":"2018-03-22T00:07:43.986Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
