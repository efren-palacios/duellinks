The deck went up against most meta decks and won. Legitimately has strong match ups across the board. Really enjoyed this deck and fusion/BoHaE variants but this seems to be the optimal build. I played 3 mirror matches which are quite difficult but D-signal came in clutch. I did intend to KoG with GB but had too much fun testing D-heroes sorry to my #gladiator-beasts  brethren","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main4":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main5":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main6":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main7":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main8":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Cosmic Cyclone","main12":"Destiny Draw","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Destiny Signal","main17":"Destiny Signal","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-03-07T17:26:58.900Z","tags":["comment-subscription"],"layout":"post"}
