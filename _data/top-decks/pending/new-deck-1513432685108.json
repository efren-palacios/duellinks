Definitely has issues with ninjas still but I only faced one on my climb. A toss up vs. CA, mostly due to floodgate/econ but the double fusion being able to get over a floodgated dakini proved very useful as well. This deck annihilates dd burn and never felt even close to losing vs the many of those I faced. All you have to do is not trigger ddraw, destroy that field spell with bestiari (floodgate rabbit/sky for a non damage GB attack) and easy victory. This deck is above rez imo, and is tier 2 by itself. The revival trap was for testing and really only helped in 2-3 duels and most cases another dimacari would have worked there honestly. Overall, 9.5/10, would play again.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main13":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Impenetrable Attack","main16":"Impenetrable Attack","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2017-12-16T13:58:05.108Z"}
