You can set up for otks pretty quickly or at least leave your opponent in a tough spot next turn with destructotron, psychokinesis, econ etc. If i had them, i'd replace the shocker with another borg and maybe find space for powerful rebirth.","main0":"Telekinetic Shocker","main1":"Destructotron","main2":"Reinforced Human Psychic Borg","main3":"Reinforced Human Psychic Borg","main4":"Serene Psychic Witch","main5":"Serene Psychic Witch","main6":"Serene Psychic Witch","main7":"Power Injector","main8":"Power Injector","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Psychokinesis","main13":"Psychokinesis","main14":"Psychokinesis","main15":"Super Rush Headlong","main16":"Super Rush Headlong","main17":"Wall of Disruption","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-03-03T22:54:36.996Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
