Did not have the 3rd emperor or even a 3rd necrofear so i opted to run a lava golem because it has very niche applications that are pretty hilarious as well as it synergizes with the deck very well. Won all 5 games I played with it beating out mill, dark magician, new water, red eyes, amd finally aliens for kog","main0":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main1":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main2":"Lava Golem","main3":"Archfiend Empress","main4":"Dark Necrofear","main5":"Dark Necrofear","main6":"Trance Archfiend","main7":"Trance Archfiend","main8":"Trance Archfiend","main9":"Doomdog Octhros","main10":"Doomdog Octhros","main11":"Doomdog Octhros","main12":"Sphere Kuriboh","main13":"Sphere Kuriboh","main14":"Sphere Kuriboh","main15":"Question","main16":"Question","main17":"Question","main18":"Escape from the Dark Dimension","main19":"Escape from the Dark Dimension","date":"2018-02-26T19:05:47.288Z"}
