Easiest kog i had ever had and the most fun. Just only got 3 anki yesterday. Tth can be used with destroying one of your monster and another opponent monster eg; kushmushroom and thats why more board control is important. Might be the best build so far for D. Heroes.","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main4":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main5":"Vision HERO Vyon","main6":"Vision HERO Vyon","main7":"Vision HERO Vyon","main8":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main9":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Cosmic Cyclone","main12":"Mask Change","main13":"Mask Change","main14":"Mask Change","main15":"Offerings to the Doomed","main16":"Offerings to the Doomed","main17":"Polymerization","main18":"Treacherous Trap Hole","main19":"Treacherous Trap Hole","extra0":"Masked HERO Anki","extra1":"Masked HERO Anki","extra2":"Masked HERO Anki","extra3":"Vision HERO Trinity","extra4":"Destiny HERO - Dangerous","timestamp":1527183261,"date":"2018-05-24T17:34:21.791Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
