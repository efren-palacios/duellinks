Then this is your deck of choice. \r\n\r\nCombo's are to thin out deck for Ra's deciple + Photon for 6k damage, tribute to doomed to get rid of monster, and Hey, Trunade to clear out backrow. Keep searching for DwD via Snoww. Can go thru about 15-16 cards in 1 turn depending on your luck.\r\n\r\nRuns into issues vs CA if they open Saffira by feeding them protection via DwD\r\nRuns into issues if you suck at coinflips depending on matchup (i.e going 1st and passing, surviving the OTK from some of the decks out there can still win you the game)\r\n\r\nNo issues vs Sylvans, SSA, Flying Fishies hence why you can KoG with this deck fairly easily. \r\n \r\nGoing to be my go-to KC cup deck for sure.","main0":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main1":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main2":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main3":"Broww, Huntsman of Dark World","main4":"Ra's Disciple","main5":"Ra's Disciple","main6":"Ra's Disciple","main7":"Dark World Dealings","main8":"Dark World Dealings","main9":"Dark World Dealings","main10":"Into the Void","main11":"Into the Void","main12":"Into the Void","main13":"Photon Booster","main14":"Photon Booster","main15":"Photon Booster","main16":"Tribute to the Doomed","main17":"Tribute to the Doomed","main18":"Hey, Trunade!","main19":"Hey, Trunade!","date":"2018-04-07T06:12:47.212Z"}
