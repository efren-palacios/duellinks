Even with the nerf erata from the TCG. It's OP. It's like if Sniper Hunter was good. The only boss monster with protection from his effect is Legendary Fisherman II\r\n- oh and you automatically take a hard L against elemental heroes","main0":"Citadel Whale","main1":"Citadel Whale","main2":"Citadel Whale","main3":"Abyss Soldier","main4":"Abyss Soldier","main5":"Abyss Soldier","main6":"Gishki Chain","main7":"Gishki Chain","main8":"Gishki Chain","main9":"Gishki Beast","main10":"Gishki Beast","main11":"Gishki Ariel","main12":"Gishki Ariel","main13":"Gishki Ariel","main14":"A Legendary Ocean","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Enemy Controller","main18":"Sea Stealth Attack","main19":"Sea Stealth Attack","date":"2018-03-08T02:04:29.820Z"}
