Getting first KOG ever, 2. Getting KOG with a non top tier deck and 3. Getting KOG in under 35)\r\n\r\nThis deck is far from optimal but it's quite fun to use. Good MU vs Amazons, okay vs Heroes and iffy vs Sylvans. I do love using my \"own\" deck though, and I like that it doesn't really look similar to anything else on the ladder.\r\nIf I had last gamble that would be the more optimal skill","main0":"Vision HERO Witch Raider","main1":"Vision HERO Witch Raider","main2":"Vision HERO Witch Raider","main3":"Dekoichi the Battlechanted Locomotive","main4":"Dekoichi the Battlechanted Locomotive","main5":"Crystal Seer","main6":"Crystal Seer","main7":"Crystal Seer","main8":"Mask Change","main9":"Mask Change","main10":"Mask Change","main11":"Divine Wrath","main12":"Draining Shield","main13":"Draining Shield","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Wall of Disruption","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","extra0":"Masked HERO Anki","extra1":"Masked HERO Anki","extra2":"Masked HERO Anki","timestamp":1527193857,"date":"2018-05-24T20:30:57.683Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
