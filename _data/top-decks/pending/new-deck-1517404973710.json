Almost every matchup was the same, storm first turn. Get wyvern or rez in graveyard. Next is bacon then usually set after. Wasnt afraid of trading monster for monster as you would have lots of ways to get rez back using wyvern, gozuki and red spirit.","main0":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main1":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main2":"Red-Eyes Wyvern","main3":"Gozuki","main4":"Gozuki","main5":"Gozuki","main6":"Samurai Skull","main7":"Samurai Skull","main8":"Bacon Saver","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Red-Eyes Insight","main12":"Red-Eyes Insight","main13":"Red-Eyes Insight","main14":"Storm","main15":"Storm","main16":"Storm","main17":"Curse of Anubis","main18":"Red-Eyes Spirit","main19":"Red-Eyes Spirit","date":"2018-01-31T13:22:53.710Z"}
