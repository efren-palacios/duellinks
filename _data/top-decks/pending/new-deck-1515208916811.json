Brillant use of genex searcher and powerful rebirth. Used it from Legend 1 all the way to KOG with no switching, I was just having fun with the deck then the next thing I knew I was in KOG. Basic combo is set searcher and rebirth. Let searcher die, SS turbine, then powerful rebirth the searcher. It comes back as a level 5 with 2100 atk because of turbine. Now you can use beatdown because powerful rebirth brought it back as a level 5. The rest of the deck really doesn't need explaining.","main0":"Genex Army","main1":"Genex Army","main2":"Genex Searcher","main3":"Genex Searcher","main4":"Genex Searcher","main5":"Sergeant Electro","main6":"Sergeant Electro","main7":"Genex Turbine","main8":"Genex Turbine","main9":"Sphere Kuriboh","main10":"Super Rush Headlong","main11":"Super Rush Headlong","main12":"Curse of Anubis","main13":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Powerful Rebirth","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Pulse Mines","main18":"Pulse Mines","main19":"Xing Zhen Hu","date":"2018-01-06T03:21:56.811Z"}
