Hermitree is probably the best card in the deck though, it is great for multiple reasons 1.) stacking the deck to set up your mills for Marshalleaf or Guardioak and 2.) it's almost always a +1 and sometimes a +2 if you excavate Kumushroom or Marshalleaf; it was also rather easy to summon, even to hard summon it. Guardioak is there for the excavate 3 and for a 1 tribute if you have to manually flip your kumushroom. I opted to play monster reincarnation as it helps pull hermitree from grave and combos well with rose lover. This is nowhere near optimized, jar of avarice was really good at times and really bad at others, I would probably cut it for a 3rd econ\r\n\r\nOh also this was from Leg 1 to KOG","main0":"Sylvan Hermitree","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Hermitree","main3":"Sylvan Guardioak","main4":"Sylvan Flowerknight","main5":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main6":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main7":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main8":"Rose Lover","main9":"Rose Lover","main10":"Rose Lover","main11":"Sylvan Peaskeeper","main12":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main13":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main14":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Monster Reincarnation","main18":"Monster Reincarnation","main19":"Jar of Avarice","date":"2018-03-15T01:47:06.479Z"}
