The main issue I had was against Dakini, I'm glad that's getting nerfed.\r\n\r\nMy main issue was against 3SD Hazy Flame when they explode and I often found myself using Essidari to hold them back or to get over their bigger monster.\r\n\r\nThe addition of Wall of Disrespect really worked out for me. Windstorm was decent but I often ended up having it at the worst time, while I found myself loving every second with this card.\r\n\r\nI am now a 6th time KoG player and an F2P one at that, and I have all of you to thank for it.\r\n\r\nMy last duel before I got promoted was a Tea Bamboo and I was on the brink with 500 LP and  it felt good to see them surrender.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Cosmic Cyclone","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Forbidden Chalice","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Curse of Anubis","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Impenetrable Attack","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-01-06T02:28:22.373Z"}
