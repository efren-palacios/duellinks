Started using it in Legend after getting out of pltinum with 3sd Hazy.  Screwed around a lot in platinum testing various decks at the start of the season so I didn't hit Kog till 112 wins. Hazy ran through Plat once I decided to actually start climbing.\r\n\r\n Originally had a 3/2 split of Transformation and Art Notebook but it felt off so I swapped to a 2/3 split and it felt more consistent. Climb was straight forward after that. Fell out of Leg3 once due to a missplay-connection issue-brick string that tilted me pretty hard. \r\n\r\nRip 3sd","main0":"Black Dragon Ninja","main1":"Black Dragon Ninja","main2":"Black Dragon Ninja","main3":"Red Dragon Ninja","main4":"Red Dragon Ninja","main5":"Red Dragon Ninja","main6":"Senior Silver Ninja","main7":"Masked Ninja Ebisu","main8":"Masked Ninja Ebisu","main9":"Armed Ninja","main10":"Crimson Ninja","main11":"Armor Ninjitsu Art of Alchemy","main12":"Ninjitsu Art Notebook","main13":"Ninjitsu Art Notebook","main14":"Ninjitsu Art Notebook","main15":"Ninjitsu Art of Duplication","main16":"Ninjitsu Art of Duplication","main17":"Ninjitsu Art of Duplication","main18":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","main19":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","date":"2017-12-31T14:55:49.815Z"}
