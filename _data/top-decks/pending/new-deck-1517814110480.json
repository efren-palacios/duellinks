As for CAffira deck, lost 2x promo with mind scan, couldnt reach promo with restart, lost 1x promo with standard build balance. And finally switched 1 petite with bacon and it did the job. If you're going first with saffira and bacon in hand, choose draw 2 and discard the bacon instead of the usual discard from opponents hand. It saved me from some e-con take attempts.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main2":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main3":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Benten","main7":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main10":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main11":"Bacon Saver","main12":"Cyber Petit Angel","main13":"Hymn of Light","main14":"Hymn of Light","main15":"Hymn of Light","main16":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main17":"Machine Angel Ritual","main18":"Sprite's Blessing","main19":"Sprite's Blessing","date":"2018-02-05T07:01:50.480Z"}
