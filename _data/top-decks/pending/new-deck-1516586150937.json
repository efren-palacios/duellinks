I know, it hurts to not have a 20 card deck), but I felt it was necessary for helping mill the opponent if they were trying to stall as well.  Jar of Avarice also helps a lot when people realize what you are trying to do.  Gladiators have a good match-up versus this deck as they can keep one monster on the field and keep cycling/constantly cycle the Essedarii to keep their deck count the same indefinitely.  This also has good match-ups versus Weevil and DDraw burn which I ran into a fair number of on the climb.  Don't recommend this for everyone since it usually means long 30-40 turn games, but I was tilted and wanted to tilt others so I stuck with it to KOG.","main0":"Lava Golem","main1":"Lava Golem","main2":"Warm Worm","main3":"Sphere Kuriboh","main4":"Sphere Kuriboh","main5":"Sphere Kuriboh","main6":"Golden Ladybug","main7":"Golden Ladybug","main8":"Golden Ladybug","main9":"Temple of the Mind's Eye","main10":"Temple of the Mind's Eye","main11":"Temple of the Mind's Eye","main12":"Draining Shield","main13":"Draining Shield","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Jar of Avarice","main18":"Massivemorph","main19":"Massivemorph","main20":"Massivemorph","date":"2018-01-22T01:55:50.937Z","timestamp":1516586150}
