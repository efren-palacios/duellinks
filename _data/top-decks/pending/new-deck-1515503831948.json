Cursed Bamboo's bounce effect also lets him hit directly for 1700 if convenient.\r\n-3 Iron Blacksmith Kotatsu to search out Cursed Bamboo Sword or even Sword of Deep-Seated to avoid topdecking it.\r\n-2 Lava Golem with Ante are anti-swarm + more burn.\r\n-1 Magical Mallet to circumvent some ded hands.\r\n-Sword of Deep-Seated can be a quick 1k burn on opponent's End Phase (since you draw the sword again), and enables Jars of Avarice if you happen to empty your deck.\r\n-2 Rainbow Life to deny/heal damage over one whole turn.\r\n-2 Jars of Avarice to recycle Bamboo first and other cards second.\r\n-Curse of Anubis as a general defense in a rampant effect monster meta.\r\n-Type Zero Magic Crusher is your main form of attack. Spend Cursed Bamboo, search Golden. Spend Deep-Seated, avoid decking out. Spend other spells if you think you have lethal.","main0":"Lava Golem","main1":"Lava Golem","main2":"Eco, Mystical Spirit of the Forest","main3":"Iron Blacksmith Kotetsu","main4":"Iron Blacksmith Kotetsu","main5":"Iron Blacksmith Kotetsu","main6":"Ante","main7":"Broken Bamboo Sword","main8":"Cursed Bamboo Sword","main9":"Cursed Bamboo Sword","main10":"Cursed Bamboo Sword","main11":"Golden Bamboo Sword","main12":"Golden Bamboo Sword","main13":"Golden Bamboo Sword","main14":"Magical Mallet","main15":"Parallel Twister","main16":"Sword of Deep-Seated","main17":"Curse of Anubis","main18":"Jar of Avarice","main19":"Jar of Avarice","main20":"Rainbow Life","main21":"Rainbow Life","main22":"Type Zero Magic Crusher","main23":"Type Zero Magic Crusher","date":"2018-01-09T13:17:11.948Z"}
