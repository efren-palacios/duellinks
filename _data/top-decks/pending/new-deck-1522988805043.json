Honestly wouldâ€™ve played more Brethren if I had them. The deck played really well. Definitely needs balance. Bricked a ton trying other skills. Sylvans and Cyber Angels can be tough, especially if Sylvans go first. Overall I like the matchup against almost everything else. Especially Aliens. It destroys Aliens.","main0":"Geargiattacker","main1":"Geargiattacker","main2":"Geargianchor","main3":"Geargianchor","main4":"Geargianchor","main5":"Geargiarsenal","main6":"Geargiarsenal","main7":"Geargiarsenal","main8":"Geargiaccelerator","main9":"Geargiaccelerator","main10":"Forbidden Chalice","main11":"Super Rush Headlong","main12":"Super Rush Headlong","main13":"Ties of the Brethren","main14":"Curse of Anubis","main15":"Needle Ceiling","main16":"Needle Ceiling","main17":"Pulse Mines","main18":"Pulse Mines","main19":"Pulse Mines","date":"2018-04-06T04:26:45.043Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
