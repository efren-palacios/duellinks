Sogen is the preferred skill for most people, but this deck attracted me as a pure control deck, and imo it's better to go for either consistency with Balance, or Mind Scan. And I feel like the latter is significantly better, as playing around backrow, and destroying the right set cards are critical to your success; if you like Sams, try it for 5 games or so and see how you like it. \r\n\r\nEnishi is great and honestly feels like a TCG card; with more Six Sam support (Grandmaster, Kizan, etc), Shogun might be more preferred to win games quickly, but Enishi will always be safer and more consistent to go for.
