Econ good for aliens/CA and SRH for the abundance of alien counterdecks everywhere like Hazy/SSA.  3 PR is optimal but not necessary. WOD is still one of the best traps in the game besides SSA atm. To not run FDC in this deck is criminal.","main0":"Golden Flying Fish","main1":"Golden Flying Fish","main2":"Golden Flying Fish","main3":"Hammer Shark","main4":"Hammer Shark","main5":"Hammer Shark","main6":"Oyster Meister","main7":"Oyster Meister","main8":"Oyster Meister","main9":"Beautunaful Princess","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Super Rush Headlong","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Fish Depth Charge","main15":"Powerful Rebirth","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-03-07T14:35:39.124Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
