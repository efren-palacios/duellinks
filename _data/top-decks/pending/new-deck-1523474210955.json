Went with Sylvans first but after 2 promo losses and a CA, Hazy god hands, and mirror match brick fest fueled tilt back to L1 figured f-it, try to win turn 2 or 3 every game. Originally the 2 trunades were SK's but after looking at the other 2 decks on the website I liked AlexNZ's inclusion of the trunades as a more win-now card, they definitely helped more than the SK's were. Not many bricks surprisingly, most of the few losses it took with this were going first and getting OTK'd round 2 by waiting, but even those were few. Dealt with Sylvans very well.","main0":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main1":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main2":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main3":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main4":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main5":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main6":"Trance Archfiend","main7":"Trance Archfiend","main8":"Trance Archfiend","main9":"Broww, Huntsman of Dark World","main10":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main11":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main12":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main13":"Dark World Dealings","main14":"Dark World Dealings","main15":"Dark World Dealings","main16":"Dark World Lightning","main17":"Dark World Lightning","main18":"Hey, Trunade!","main19":"Hey, Trunade!","date":"2018-04-11T19:16:50.955Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
