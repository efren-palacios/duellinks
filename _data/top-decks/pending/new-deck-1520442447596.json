Destiny heroes have never been about a themed deck only with them, but rather support cards with other strong cards. Got kog in 40 ish games and didnt lose a single game until legend 2. This is a slightly weaker wallet control in my opinion. @Dkayed Here's a ugabunga deck for your youtube. You can also easily get 3-5 cards for snipe hunter ammo.","main0":"Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight","main1":"Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main4":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main5":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main6":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main7":"Snipe Hunter","main8":"Snipe Hunter","main9":"Snipe Hunter","main10":"Beginning of Heaven and Earth","main11":"Beginning of Heaven and Earth","main12":"Beginning of Heaven and Earth","main13":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-03-07T17:07:27.595Z","tags":["comment-subscription"],"layout":"post"}
