Being able to dig into your deck every turn for your combos and fusions is so good. Every card in the deck felt like it belonged and was never dead. Vision hero vyon is by far the best card in this deck. If I have him in hand feels like I never brick. Also I'd play a 3rd hex seal if I had him, red eyes slash dragon is pretty good in this deck","main0":"Black Luster Soldier - Sacred Soldier","main1":"Black Luster Soldier - Sacred Soldier","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main4":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main5":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main6":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main7":"The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion","main8":"The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion","main9":"Vision HERO Vyon","main10":"Vision HERO Vyon","main11":"Vision HERO Vyon","main12":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main13":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main14":"Destiny HERO - Dreamer","main15":"Destiny HERO - Dreamer","main16":"Anti-Magic Arrows","main17":"Cosmic Cyclone","main18":"Destiny Draw","main19":"Enemy Controller","main20":"Enemy Controller","main21":"Polymerization","main22":"Polymerization","main23":"Polymerization","main24":"Beginning of Heaven and Earth","main25":"Beginning of Heaven and Earth","main26":"Beginning of Heaven and Earth","main27":"Powerful Rebirth","main28":"Powerful Rebirth","main29":"Powerful Rebirth","extra0":"Red-Eyes Slash Dragon","extra1":"Red-Eyes Slash Dragon","extra2":"Vision HERO Trinity","extra3":"Destiny HERO - Dangerous","extra4":"Destiny HERO - Dangerous","date":"2018-03-11T01:40:38.370Z"}
