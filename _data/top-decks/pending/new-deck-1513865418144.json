Faced a lot of mirror matches and OTK'd 3 of them only because of Nobleman, Nobleman was MVP! taking out those floodgates and econs. I'd run 3 nobles if I had another. Better play them before the nerf.\r\nI took out a Benten cause the 3rd one bricked me a lot.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main2":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main3":"Cyber Angel Benten","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main6":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main7":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Sonic Bird","main10":"Cyber Petit Angel","main11":"Cyber Petit Angel","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main14":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main15":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main16":"Machine Angel Ritual","main17":"Nobleman of Extermination","main18":"Nobleman of Extermination","main19":"Xing Zhen Hu","date":"2017-12-21T14:10:18.144Z"}
