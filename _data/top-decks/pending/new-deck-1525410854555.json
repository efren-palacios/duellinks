I figured, if I've got prismatic sages + willpower, might as well use 'em.\r\n\r\nPrincess is the gal you wanna see in your hand. So versatile, you can attack with a mon, then use Princess to tag it out for Queen. Sage is probably the least useful mon but I'm running her because as I mentioned, they're prismatic. I can't say I've gotten too many useful backrow pops off of her. I'd consider even running Fighters here because getting hit with WoD is still a possibility, and very unpleasant.\r\n\r\nW1) D-heros. Banished all his resources and attacked for game.\r\nW2) Another D-heros who suffered the same fate\r\nW3) Spellbooks centred around dropping my Atk to 0 using WoD and then boosting up a single spellcaster to 4000 that was promptly thwarted by Econ\r\nW4) Masked E-heros (Neos). It didn't work\r\nW5) Destiny Calling D-heros, he got me down to 400 LP but ran out of steam","main0":"Amazoness Queen","main1":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main2":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main3":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main4":"Amazoness Sage","main5":"Amazoness Sage","main6":"Amazoness Princess","main7":"Amazoness Princess","main8":"Amazoness Princess","main9":"Amazoness Baby Tiger","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Forbidden Chalice","main14":"Forbidden Chalice","main15":"Amazoness Onslaught","main16":"Amazoness Onslaught","main17":"Amazoness Onslaught","main18":"Amazoness Willpower","main19":"Powerful Rebirth","date":"2018-05-04T05:14:14.554Z","tags":[],"pageless":true,"templateKey":"comments","timestamp":1525410854,"layout":"post","message":" "}
