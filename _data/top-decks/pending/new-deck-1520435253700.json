Decider is the true MVP imo of this deck. We are in a meta where high lvl monsters are more common, and his effect has won me quite a few games giving me the time to stall and draw what I need. Celestial draw power is also nuts, and helps so much in getting you a extra lifeline if shits looking bad. I decided to throw 1 dreamer in to basically act like a bacon saver, which came in clutch quite a few times. 2 D-fusion over Polly because I like the idea of a surprise OTK, or even playing around WOD, since with Drilldarks effect it makes it pretty damn easy to pull off. Also helps because people who play this game are fucking retarded and donâ€™t read card effects half the time, so fusing into Dangerous can also be clutch af.  Cyclones obviously to mainly deal with water, but also for an easy pop for destiny calling.","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main4":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main5":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main6":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main7":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main8":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main9":"Destiny HERO - Dreamer","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Cosmic Cyclone","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"D-Fusion","main16":"D-Fusion","main17":"Mirror Wall","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-03-07T15:07:33.700Z","tags":["comment-subscription"],"layout":"post"}
