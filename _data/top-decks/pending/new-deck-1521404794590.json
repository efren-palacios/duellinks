I didn't lose from legend 1 to kog with this. Wrath/Providence are autowins vs the mirror and vs CA when they summon Dakini via Absolute ritual. Also think Forbidden Chalice could be good too though, possibly even better because it's much more versatile, doesn't miss timing on Dakini ever, and hits Mushroom in the dmg step.","main0":"Sylvan Hermitree","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Hermitree","main3":"Sylvan Guardioak","main4":"Sylvan Guardioak","main5":"World Carrotweight Champion","main6":"World Carrotweight Champion","main7":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main8":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main9":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main10":"Rose Lover","main11":"Rose Lover","main12":"Rose Lover","main13":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main14":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main15":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main16":"Divine Wrath","main17":"Divine Wrath","main18":"Ultimate Providence","main19":"Ultimate Providence","date":"2018-03-18T20:26:34.590Z"}
