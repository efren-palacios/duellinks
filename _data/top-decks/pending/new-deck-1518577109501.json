My goal first was to KoG with a Power of Darkness of Peak performance deck for the memes. But that was kinda hard to do to be honest. A lot of decks have heavy backrow or floodgates and it makes it kinda hard to have those 5 wins in a row. After some time I used REZ STTG, but CA was kinda a problem vs REZ. Was pretty hard to deal with 2 high Attack targets. After that I switched to CA, but Suddenly I played Burn after Burn after Burn. So then a teammate, Jaydizzle, told me to just run Fairyâ€™s Smile instead of Balance. So I did that, and magically no Burn decks appeared in my 5 matches to KoG. Even though this is the deck I hit KoG with, I used a high variety of decks.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main2":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main3":"Cyber Angel Benten","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main7":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main10":"Cyber Petit Angel","main11":"Cyber Petit Angel","main12":"Fenghuang","main13":"Hymn of Light","main14":"Hymn of Light","main15":"Hymn of Light","main16":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main17":"Machine Angel Ritual","main18":"Sprite's Blessing","main19":"Sprite's Blessing","date":"2018-02-14T02:58:29.501Z","timestamp":1518577109,"commentDate":"2018-02-14T02:58:29.501Z","slug":"{options.slug}","approved":false,"article":"{options.slug}"}
