Also really high win ratio against cyber angels and ninjas as they didn't seem to draw greatly many times, yet this deck gave me very consistent starting hands almost every time.\r\n\r\nAlso semi-free to play friendly since i don't have another soul exchange. Hazy glory isn't just a replacement for it. Sometimes the monster draw effect can be clutch.","main0":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main1":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main2":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main3":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main4":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main5":"Flame Tiger","main6":"Flame Tiger","main7":"Hazy Flame Peryton","main8":"Caninetaur","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Soul Exchange","main13":"Beast Rising","main14":"Beast Rising","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Hazy Glory","main18":"Hazy Glory","main19":"Mirror Wall","date":"2017-12-17T00:41:49.487Z"}
