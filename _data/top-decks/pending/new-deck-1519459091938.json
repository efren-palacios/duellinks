If I had more Atlantis, I would probably rep the Abyss card. More fishermans is nice, but I would probably rep the ships with one if I did get a third. I think two is healthy though. This deck is more powerful than it should be because opponents sleep on the second effect of SSA and don't understand the remove-from-play abuse.","main0":"Citadel Whale","main1":"Mecha Sea Dragon Plesion","main2":"Mecha Sea Dragon Plesion","main3":"Mecha Sea Dragon Plesion","main4":"The Legendary Fisherman II","main5":"The Legendary Fisherman II","main6":"B.E.S.
