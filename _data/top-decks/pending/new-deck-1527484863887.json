It was workable to replace a Bedwyr with a third Drystan but Bedwyr’s ability to move equip cards was MVP of some matches. I even use Bedwyr’s first effect to thin the deck when I need a monster occasionally. I didn’t lose a single match to Sylvans after adding a second Arfeudutyr - basically having 5 of them due to the ability to search them out with Glory. I also didn’t lose a single match to Amazons with 3 Double Cyclones. My worst matchup has been a fast Masked Hero deck with opening hand removal. But in closing, I would just like to give a quick message to Sylvans... don’t let the door hit you in the butt on the way out.","main0":"Noble Knight Drystan","main1":"Noble Knight Drystan","main2":"Noble Knight Medraut","main3":"Noble Knight Medraut","main4":"Noble Knight Medraut","main5":"Noble Knight Bedwyr","main6":"Noble Knight Bedwyr","main7":"Double Cyclone","main8":"Double Cyclone","main9":"Double Cyclone","main10":"Glory of the Noble Knights","main11":"Glory of the Noble Knights","main12":"Glory of the Noble Knights","main13":"Noble Arms - Arfeudutyr","main14":"Noble Arms - Arfeudutyr","main15":"Noble Arms - Caliburn","main16":"Noble Arms - Gallatin","main17":"Noble Arms of Destiny","main18":"Noble Arms of Destiny","main19":"Treacherous Trap Hole","date":"2018-05-28T05:21:03.887Z","tags":["comment-subscription"],"timestamp":1527484863,"layout":"post","message":" "}
