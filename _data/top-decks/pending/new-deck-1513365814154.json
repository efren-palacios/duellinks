Mind scan helped a lot in this random ladder, seriously, I was being tilt because of summoned bestiari into wild tornado. I hated chalice, was always a -2 for me cuz I always had to spend another card to protect my monster, half shut helped a lot in ninjas and electros matchup, I missed Impenstrable attack only in the CA matchup, but my backrow already have 8 cards to deal with them, so... Got twice into kog promo with gladiators then demoted myself to L1 to practice a bit with Ninjas.","main0":"Black Dragon Ninja","main1":"Black Dragon Ninja","main2":"Black Dragon Ninja","main3":"Red Dragon Ninja","main4":"Red Dragon Ninja","main5":"Red Dragon Ninja","main6":"Senior Silver Ninja","main7":"Masked Ninja Ebisu","main8":"Crimson Ninja","main9":"Crimson Ninja","main10":"Armor Ninjitsu Art of Alchemy","main11":"Ninjitsu Art Notebook","main12":"Ninjitsu Art Notebook","main13":"Ninjitsu Art Notebook","main14":"Ninjitsu Art of Duplication","main15":"Ninjitsu Art of Duplication","main16":"Ninjitsu Art of Duplication","main17":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","main18":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","main19":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","date":"2017-12-15T19:23:34.154Z","timestamp":1513365814}
