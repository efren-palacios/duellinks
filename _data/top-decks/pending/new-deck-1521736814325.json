The Trunades are a great addition since a floodgate would stop the naturia plays very hard. Before trunade i used anti magic arrows but people know that naturia play ama so i switched to trunade. If you wanna have some fun try it out but dont expect it to be a easy king of games run. I needed a lot of wins to finally get to kog. Also Im the first guy who posts a kog naturia list :P","main0":"Naturia Stag Beetle","main1":"Naturia Stag Beetle","main2":"Naturia Stag Beetle","main3":"Naturia Hydrangea","main4":"Naturia Hydrangea","main5":"Naturia Hydrangea","main6":"Naturia Pumpkin","main7":"Naturia Pumpkin","main8":"Naturia Pumpkin","main9":"Naturia Marron","main10":"Naturia Marron","main11":"Naturia Marron","main12":"Naturia Pineapple","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Wall of Disruption","main17":"Hey, Trunade!","main18":"Hey, Trunade!","main19":"Hey, Trunade!","extra0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","extra1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","extra2":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","date":"2018-03-22T16:40:14.324Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
