Got to Legend with Sylvans then tilted due to running into OTK CA a few games in a row.  Switched to flying fish and had more success.   Special thanks to CwC | Kagami for the amazing encouragement and tips that pushed me to grind it out the last couple of days and to skillShot for giving me advice on the game after his recent tournament win - and of course the Discord and all it's members. Thanks!","main0":"Golden Flying Fish","main1":"Golden Flying Fish","main2":"Golden Flying Fish","main3":"Hammer Shark","main4":"Hammer Shark","main5":"Hammer Shark","main6":"Oyster Meister","main7":"Oyster Meister","main8":"Oyster Meister","main9":"Beautunaful Princess","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Parallel Twister","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Super Rush Headlong","main15":"Fish Depth Charge","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-03-30T18:19:57.251Z","threadClosed":"false"}
