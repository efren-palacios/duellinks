I found offerings very helpful in most situations (against sylvans especially, never really drew it against amazons sadly). I rarely drew tth, but I still did very well without it. Econ was only helpful against spellbooks and archfiends, which both decks were rare to come by. I only regretted not running dreamer when against mirror, or trying to get another monster out (dreamer) for masked change for a quick win. Most loses were from amazons (probably from lack of cc), but I didnt have trouble against any other deck (only played one spellbooks, so I cant say much about that matchup).","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main4":"Vision HERO Vyon","main5":"Vision HERO Vyon","main6":"Vision HERO Vyon","main7":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main8":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Forbidden Chalice","main12":"Forbidden Chalice","main13":"Mask Change","main14":"Mask Change","main15":"Mask Change","main16":"Offerings to the Doomed","main17":"Offerings to the Doomed","main18":"Polymerization","main19":"Treacherous Trap Hole","extra0":"Masked HERO Anki","extra1":"Masked HERO Anki","extra2":"Masked HERO Anki","extra3":"Vision HERO Trinity","extra4":"Destiny HERO - Dangerous","date":"2018-05-22T04:55:49.765Z"}
