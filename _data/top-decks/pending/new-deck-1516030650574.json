Thought I'd give @BuiltToTilt ninja deck a try, and it works so well. Think I lost twice from L2 to KOG, even bricked on my kog rank up match and still turned it around for a win. Great deck, Tier 3 at the very least.","main0":"Black Dragon Ninja","main1":"Red Dragon Ninja","main2":"Red Dragon Ninja","main3":"Red Dragon Ninja","main4":"Flame Armor Ninja","main5":"Flame Armor Ninja","main6":"Flame Armor Ninja","main7":"Earth Armor Ninja","main8":"Earth Armor Ninja","main9":"Masked Ninja Ebisu","main10":"Masked Ninja Ebisu","main11":"Masked Ninja Ebisu","main12":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main13":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Ninjitsu Art of Duplication","main16":"Ninjitsu Art of Duplication","main17":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","main18":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","main19":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","date":"2018-01-15T15:37:30.574Z"}
