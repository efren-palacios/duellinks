Started in legend 2, didn't lose and went straight to KOG. MVP is probably storm. Most of wins were Storm + Red-Eyes Return + Econ plays at turn 3/4 for otk. Saw I needed to topdeck storm quite oftenly so put one more than in Whybona's deck. Rest is netdecked.","main0":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main1":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main2":"Gozuki","main3":"Gozuki","main4":"Gozuki","main5":"Samurai Skull","main6":"Samurai Skull","main7":"Bacon Saver","main8":"Gladiator Beast Andal","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Red-Eyes Insight","main13":"Red-Eyes Insight","main14":"Storm","main15":"Storm","main16":"Storm","main17":"Curse of Anubis","main18":"Mirror Wall","main19":"Mirror Wall","main20":"Red-Eyes Spirit","main21":"Red-Eyes Spirit","date":"2018-02-24T08:34:39.059Z"}
