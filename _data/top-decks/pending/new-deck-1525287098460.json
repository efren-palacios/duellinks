Most games where 3 would have been lethal I ended up winning anyways. TTH is good, but I ended up blowing up one of my own monsters a lot. A pretty standard build overall.","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main4":"Vision HERO Vyon","main5":"Vision HERO Vyon","main6":"Vision HERO Vyon","main7":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main8":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main9":"Destiny HERO - Dreamer","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Forbidden Chalice","main13":"Forbidden Chalice","main14":"Mask Change","main15":"Mask Change","main16":"Mask Change","main17":"Polymerization","main18":"Tribute to the Doomed","main19":"Treacherous Trap Hole","extra0":"Masked HERO Anki","extra1":"Masked HERO Anki","extra2":"Vision HERO Trinity","extra3":"Destiny HERO - Dangerous","extra4":"Destiny HERO - Dangerous","date":"2018-05-02T18:51:38.460Z","tags":[]}
