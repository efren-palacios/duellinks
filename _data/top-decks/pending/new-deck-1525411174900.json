Vision hero witch was pretty good to get rid of wall of d'ed monsters or extra onslaughts and clear backrow also willpower is better than rebirth cos you can search it with princess love you all and i wanna see more amazoness decks hit KoG","main0":"Vision HERO Witch Raider","main1":"Amazoness Paladin","main2":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main3":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main4":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main5":"Amazoness Sage","main6":"Amazoness Sage","main7":"Amazoness Princess","main8":"Amazoness Princess","main9":"Amazoness Princess","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Forbidden Chalice","main13":"Forbidden Chalice","main14":"Amazoness Onslaught","main15":"Amazoness Onslaught","main16":"Amazoness Onslaught","main17":"Amazoness Willpower","main18":"Mirror Wall","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-05-04T05:19:34.900Z","tags":[],"pageless":true,"templateKey":"comments","timestamp":1525411174,"layout":"post","message":" "}
