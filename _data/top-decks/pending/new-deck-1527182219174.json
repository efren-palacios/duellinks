Only have 2 structure decks so I'm running an extra Decider instead of third Vyon like most people. Was running mirror wall in plat instead of treacherous then once I hit Legend I bought some sales and picked up treacherous.  Got tilted too many times in Legend 2 and 3 losing a Kog promo, eventually dropped 1 Econ and added Cyclone. The only cyclone I have put in some work for sure. Amazons were definitely my hardest match ups.","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main4":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main5":"Vision HERO Vyon","main6":"Vision HERO Vyon","main7":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main8":"Destiny HERO - Malicious","main9":"Destiny HERO - Dreamer","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Destiny Draw","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Forbidden Chalice","main14":"Forbidden Chalice","main15":"Mask Change","main16":"Mask Change","main17":"Mask Change","main18":"Polymerization","main19":"Treacherous Trap Hole","extra0":"Masked HERO Anki","extra1":"Masked HERO Anki","extra2":"Masked HERO Anki","extra3":"Vision HERO Trinity","extra4":"Destiny HERO - Dangerous","timestamp":1527182219,"date":"2018-05-24T17:16:59.174Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
