I am a good dino duelist so for me its might have been easier to reach KOG. \r\n\r\nNormally, I dont get KOG this early in the season but I got triggered from a tourney and did this run with dinos in legend  3 went 5-0.\r\n\r\nDinos are actually good, people sleep on them. Not top tier but still viable with the backrow in this slow meta. Dino channel for more discussion.  I do have another secret build which is good.\r\n\r\nThanks to @tekumse - Dino Expert for listening to my stupid ideas haha. I apologise.","main0":"Evilswarm Salamandra","main1":"Black Brachios","main2":"Black Brachios","main3":"Hydrogeddon","main4":"Hydrogeddon","main5":"Hydrogeddon","main6":"Sphere Kuriboh","main7":"Sabersaurus","main8":"Sabersaurus","main9":"Sabersaurus","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Fossil Dig","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Super Rush Headlong","main15":"Paleozoic Canadia","main16":"Paleozoic Canadia","main17":"Swamp Mirrorer","main18":"Swamp Mirrorer","main19":"Swamp Mirrorer","date":"2018-05-09T05:33:22.627Z","timestamp":1525844002}
