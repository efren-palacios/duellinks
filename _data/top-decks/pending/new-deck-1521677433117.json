The deck is extremely disruptive ATM since the meta hasn’t adjusted to deal with Sylvans yet. I used the same deck as wowerer’s pinned deck with +1 Providence -1  Devine since I didn’t have a 2nd Devine. Not much difference between Providence and Devine since your only real fodder are monster cards anyways. Econ take carrot resummon, and Econ take rose special summon are clutch.","main0":"Sylvan Hermitree","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Guardioak","main3":"Sylvan Guardioak","main4":"Sylvan Guardioak","main5":"World Carrotweight Champion","main6":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main7":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main8":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main9":"Rose Lover","main10":"Rose Lover","main11":"Rose Lover","main12":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main13":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main14":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Enemy Controller","main18":"Divine Wrath","main19":"Ultimate Providence","date":"2018-03-22T00:10:33.117Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
