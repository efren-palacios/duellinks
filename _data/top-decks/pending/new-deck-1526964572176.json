White night finally provides dragons a respectable boss monster to abuse with arkbrave/felgrands/dragon knight and a 2nd ruins opens up a ton of plays. No game felt linear and I felt like I found a new thing the deck could do every few duels. Took longer than I expected but I won at about a 70% rate in legend, just had some seriously bad timing losses on the ladder. Oh well, at least this makes dragons notable kog being the 3rd one of the month!","main0":"White Night Dragon","main1":"White Night Dragon","main2":"White Night Dragon","main3":"Darkstorm Dragon","main4":"Darkstorm Dragon","main5":"Arkbrave Dragon","main6":"Arkbrave Dragon","main7":"Arkbrave Dragon","main8":"Dragon Knight of Creation","main9":"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress","main10":"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress","main11":"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress","main12":"Paladin of Felgrand","main13":"Paladin of Felgrand","main14":"Paladin of Felgrand","main15":"Offerings to the Doomed","main16":"Offerings to the Doomed","main17":"Offerings to the Doomed","main18":"Ruins of the Divine Dragon Lords","main19":"Ruins of the Divine Dragon Lords","main20":"That Grass Looks Greener","main21":"That Grass Looks Greener","main22":"That Grass Looks Greener","main23":"Needlebug Nest","main24":"Needlebug Nest","main25":"Paleozoic Canadia","main26":"Paleozoic Hallucigenia","main27":"Powerful Rebirth","main28":"Powerful Rebirth","main29":"Powerful Rebirth","date":"2018-05-22T04:49:32.175Z"}
