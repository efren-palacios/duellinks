Lost vs Yolo Hazy Firefist godhand and twice versus SSA without SRH in Hand. Mind Scan for the better Mirror Matchup and general control play. 22 Cards to fit 2 Floodgates in as kind of a surprise factor and higher versatility for the deck. I almost always set 1 monster and 1 backrow turn 1 to fake sylvans/aliens and even if you brick set your cards, most people will play patiently and if you draw eventually your fish, you will control the matchup via mind scan from there on. Playing passively will win most of the matches via WoD and MW, Swamp Mirrorer and PRs are for the OTK potential.","main0":"Golden Flying Fish","main1":"Golden Flying Fish","main2":"Golden Flying Fish","main3":"Hammer Shark","main4":"Hammer Shark","main5":"Hammer Shark","main6":"Oyster Meister","main7":"Oyster Meister","main8":"Oyster Meister","main9":"Beautunaful Princess","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Super Rush Headlong","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Fish Depth Charge","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Mirror Wall","main18":"Powerful Rebirth","main19":"Powerful Rebirth","main20":"Swamp Mirrorer","main21":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-03-24T19:39:15.082Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
