So dinos brought me to legend3 and then i lost a kog promo match. I was frustated and switched a little bit around (GB with every skill, Hazys, Ninjas) and then i found AG again, after loosing 1 KOG rank up match against Dinos i tried it another time after deck changes from members of this discord here and finally got KOG again. 4 Star lady bug was gold against GB and parasites Weevil.","main0":"Ancient Gear Golem","main1":"Ancient Gear Beast","main2":"Ancient Gear Knight","main3":"Ancient Gear Knight","main4":"Ancient Gear Knight","main5":"Sergeant Electro","main6":"Sergeant Electro","main7":"Sergeant Electro","main8":"4-Starred Ladybug of Doom","main9":"Sphere Kuriboh","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Mirror Wall","main18":"Pulse Mines","main19":"Pulse Mines","date":"2018-01-13T13:33:36.184Z"}
