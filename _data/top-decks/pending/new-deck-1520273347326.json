It helps a lot in the Alien matchup and gives you another way to play around Econ-takes in general. Though, Aliens will probably still win if they have an Econ-take play ready for when your boss monster comes back, but ladder players seem to prefer running 3 Triangles over Econs for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the math for Balance works with 21 cards, but I still always opened with 2 monsters and 1 spell. I opened with Dimension Gate only about 1/5 games, but I often drew into one within the first few turns.\r\n\r\nFaced mostly Aliens, Water, REZ, and D-Heroes on the climb. Aliens are still the worst matchup, and I got lucky I didn't run into any in my 5 win streak to KOG. D-Heroes are also a huge problem if you don't OTK them before they get their Deciders out. Besides those, the new Tea Mill with Warm Worm + Chain Destruction is also an auto-loss, but I only ran into 3 of those out of 40 ish games.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main2":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main3":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Benten","main7":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main10":"Cyber Petit Angel","main11":"Cyber Petit Angel","main12":"Hymn of Light","main13":"Hymn of Light","main14":"Hymn of Light","main15":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main16":"Machine Angel Ritual","main17":"Sprite's Blessing","main18":"Dimension Gate","main19":"Dimension Gate","main20":"Dimension Gate","date":"2018-03-05T18:09:07.326Z"}
