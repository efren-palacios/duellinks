Teched in a Forbidden Dress for the lols but it actually did some work. Not sure itâ€™s worth becoming a staple but certainly an interesting option that not many people seem to have been using.\r\nThree econs is essential as is three forms of negating monster effects - be it divine wrath, forbidden chalice or something else. One Chaos Hunter is also needed\r\nRestart is obvs the only viable skill at the moment. Little bit annoying - hoping Konami will change the skills up a bit in the near future to give a little more variety to duelling.","main0":"Chaos Hunter","main1":"Amazoness Queen","main2":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main3":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main4":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main5":"Amazoness Sage","main6":"Amazoness Princess","main7":"Amazoness Princess","main8":"Amazoness Princess","main9":"Amazoness Baby Tiger","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Forbidden Chalice","main14":"Forbidden Dress","main15":"Amazoness Onslaught","main16":"Amazoness Onslaught","main17":"Amazoness Willpower","main18":"Divine Wrath","main19":"Powerful Rebirth","date":"2018-05-16T17:08:35.054Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
