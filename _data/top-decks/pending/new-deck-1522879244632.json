I got from Platinum Rank 4-5 fairly easily with Dark World Emperor Hybrid but in Legend there are so many CAs, Sylvans, SSAs, Flying Fish. I tried my hand with CA, Dark World Emperor and Flying Fishes. D-Hero was able to sustain only three loss (briiiiicky city) for 20 wins L1-KOG. My KOG promo match was a Life Cost 0. Couldn't attack my Decider any ways and Masked Change for Direct Damage cucks. Faced 3 SSA and a DW deck for 5 games in L3-KOG to win it early with 70 games on the dot. I usually average 200 games a season ore more for KOG. I was testing the build that Kazaaras made and some minor tweak on my side. Didn't think I hit KOG so fast on it.","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main4":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main5":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main6":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main7":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main8":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Forbidden Chalice","main15":"Forbidden Chalice","main16":"Mask Change","main17":"Mask Change","main18":"Mask Change","main19":"Wall of Disruption","extra0":"Masked HERO Anki","extra1":"Masked HERO Anki","extra2":"Masked HERO Anki","date":"2018-04-04T22:00:44.632Z","timestamp":1522879244,"layout":"post"}
