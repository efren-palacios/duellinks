Handcrafted with hours of heavy thinking and testing. After memeing for 2 weeks in Legend 1 I wanted to invent a deck that could soar through the ranks, and this is what I’ve come up with. I’ve never seen anyone run anything similar and don’t believe I ever will. Hours of watching Rick and Morty and drinking bleach have increased my IQ by 200% according to my professors. Please feel free to test this fat 21 card deck in the ranks and tell me your results, but please be sure to be watching Rick and Morty while you do so to yield perfect results.
