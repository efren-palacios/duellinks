I love this deck so much. Chalice came in (un)surprisingly clutch in alot of matchups. I thought I'd miss Half Shut more than I did, but the ability to shut down key effects was just amazing. I went back and forth between 2 Cosmic Cyclones (cutting a Floodgate for it) but the prevelance of Cyber Angels required me to forgo the second one; If I expected a heavier Ninja meta I'd probably play around with it, as it's your best shot at beating them","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Cosmic Cyclone","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Forbidden Chalice","main13":"Forbidden Chalice","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Impenetrable Attack","main19":"Impenetrable Attack","date":"2017-12-15T17:04:52.333Z","timestamp":1513357492}
