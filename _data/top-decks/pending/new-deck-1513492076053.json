I'm honestly not that good  of a player and it was the first time I was playing this deck. First 5 days of the month Legend was full of Ninjas and I couldn't do anything against them when they had BDN + 2 M, 2 S/T in their hand, so I was frustrated and stopped playing for one day. When I came back to the ladder (the 7th) I won all my games to KoG, only facing a Ninja player once (he misplayed a lot).","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main13":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Impenetrable Attack","main16":"Impenetrable Attack","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2017-12-17T06:27:56.053Z"}
