The only issue with this is that it gives the illusion that targeting is a right and not a luxury. I was p burnt out this season and  decided before trying for kog to farm for the new UR ticket reward and try mill out. After that I got a little serious and started to use this build. Boosted hazy automatically beats life point boost/fiends farewell Archfiends because they cannot target them with effects, and fish has to rely on a reckless swing with WoD. Cyclone is teched for the SSA match up as well as the burn match up, which you can win by boosting and boosting until you draw both cyclones to get rid of temple and a card. This deck felt very refreshing to me and I hope to get more UR ticket rewards next season to improve it.","main0":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main1":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main2":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main3":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main4":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main5":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main6":"Flame Tiger","main7":"Flame Tiger","main8":"Caninetaur","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Soul Exchange","main15":"Soul Exchange","main16":"Soul Exchange","main17":"Beast Rising","main18":"Beast Rising","main19":"Beast Rising","date":"2018-03-13T00:53:22.321Z","timestamp":1520902402,"tags":["comment-subscription"]}
