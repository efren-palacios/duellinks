I just used this for the memes. It's in no way consistent and I banked on Skillvans players clicking yes on Marshalleaf to destroy their own monsters which got me the wins. So much fun and I laughed to much on the last 6 win streak to get me there.","main0":"Planet Pathfinder","main1":"Planet Pathfinder","main2":"Planet Pathfinder","main3":"Skull-Mark Ladybug","main4":"Skull-Mark Ladybug","main5":"Crystal Seer","main6":"Toon Summoned Skull","main7":"Toon Summoned Skull","main8":"Toon Summoned Skull","main9":"Toon Mermaid","main10":"Toon Mermaid","main11":"Toon Mermaid","main12":"Field Barrier","main13":"Field Barrier","main14":"Field Barrier","main15":"Magic Reflector","main16":"Magic Reflector","main17":"Soul Absorption","main18":"Toon Kingdom","main19":"Toon Rollback","main20":"Toon Table of Contents","date":"2018-04-26T06:11:03.552Z"}
