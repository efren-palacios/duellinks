The reason for cutting down 4-starred ladybug on this version was that most of my matches were not 80% against Aliens and fish decks anymore.This time, the deck worked but it became bricky shortly after. \r\n\r\nLastly, I had to cut down my 2nd broww, then I  got myself to KOG smoothly with this build   I got rejected many times on KOG promo matches, but I had to keep believing in the name of Grapha.","main0":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main1":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main2":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main3":"Dark Necrofear","main4":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main5":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main6":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main7":"Trance Archfiend","main8":"Trance Archfiend","main9":"Broww, Huntsman of Dark World","main10":"Sphere Kuriboh","main11":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main12":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main13":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main14":"Dark World Dealings","main15":"Dark World Dealings","main16":"Dark World Dealings","main17":"Dark World Lightning","main18":"The Cheerful Coffin","main19":"The Cheerful Coffin","extra0":"Five-Headed Dragon","extra1":"Arcana Knight Joker","extra2":"Dark Paladin","extra3":"XYZ-Dragon Cannon","extra4":"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon","date":"2018-03-10T20:23:45.646Z"}
