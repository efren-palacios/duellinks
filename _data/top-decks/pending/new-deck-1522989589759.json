This is the built that I reached KoG with. I like playing the control game, which is why I tried to do it without Ties Of The Brethren (which I will test out now at the KC-Cup Stage 1)\r\nI also tested Forbidden Chalice during my climb, but ultimately kicked it in favour of the rebirths.\r\nPulse Mines buys whole turns vs CA, Masked Heroes and partially Sylvans; which is often the time you need to start your engines.","main0":"Geargiattacker","main1":"Geargiattacker","main2":"Geargianchor","main3":"Geargianchor","main4":"Geargianchor","main5":"Geargiarsenal","main6":"Geargiarsenal","main7":"Geargiarsenal","main8":"Geargiaccelerator","main9":"Geargiaccelerator","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Super Rush Headlong","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Super Rush Headlong","main15":"Powerful Rebirth","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Pulse Mines","main18":"Pulse Mines","main19":"Pulse Mines","date":"2018-04-06T04:39:49.758Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
