It proved useful during longer matches when I would brick and be able to come back and win. After learning the intricacies of this deck it really deserves it's tier 2 spot. Played with a ton of decks to varying results before settling on this after watching the MCS. This deck is a ton of fun and a great way to get around the cancer that is burn. 10/10 would climb again.","main0":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main1":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main2":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main3":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main4":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main5":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main6":"Flame Tiger","main7":"Flame Tiger","main8":"Hazy Flame Peryton","main9":"Caninetaur","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Soul Exchange","main14":"Beast Rising","main15":"Beast Rising","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Hazy Glory","main18":"Mirror Wall","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2017-12-17T00:05:45.656Z"}
