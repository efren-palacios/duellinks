Many ways to build it but I chose backrow to help with glad beasts and hazy. Restart to maximize chance of opening recombination device, the main engine of the deck. Can get some nice OTKs with triangle or Econ. Sadly loses to stall decks that donâ€™t summon monsters. Might lose power as people learn how to play around it.","main0":"Alien Overlord","main1":"Alien Overlord","main2":"Alien Warrior","main3":"Alien Warrior","main4":"Alien Warrior","main5":"Alien Kid","main6":"Alien Telepath","main7":"Alien Telepath","main8":"Alien Telepath","main9":"Evil Dragon Ananta","main10":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main11":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main12":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Mysterious Triangle","main16":"Super Rush Headlong","main17":"Curse of Anubis","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Windstorm of Etaqua","date":"2018-02-24T07:21:55.546Z"}
