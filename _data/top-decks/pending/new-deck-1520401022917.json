Not only is he a great discard, he can also be used for a 2nd tribute monster to bring out whale, and best of all, he recycles himself, which makes the synergy in this deck extremely powerful.","main0":"Citadel Whale","main1":"Citadel Whale","main2":"Citadel Whale","main3":"Warrior of Atlantis","main4":"Warrior of Atlantis","main5":"Abyss Soldier","main6":"Abyss Soldier","main7":"Abyss Soldier","main8":"Hammer Shark","main9":"Hammer Shark","main10":"Sinister Serpent","main11":"Sinister Serpent","main12":"Fishborg Planter","main13":"Fishborg Planter","main14":"Fishborg Planter","main15":"A Legendary Ocean","main16":"Divine Wrath","main17":"Divine Wrath","main18":"Sea Stealth Attack","main19":"Sea Stealth Attack","date":"2018-03-07T05:37:02.917Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
