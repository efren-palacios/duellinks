Problem is anything can get over Blue Boy. So I added Fool. And a copy of DMOC. 28k Def is relevant as most decks can’t beat over it. TTH is a great card. Every game I resolved it I won. So I really tried to keep the deck count close to 20. Organization is a spell book card, and you can set it along Fate. Since most ppl are running CC. They won’t be as trigger happy. Stacking is just a plus. All 5 games from L3 to KOG were vs Amazon.","main0":"Dark Magician of Chaos","main1":"Fool of Prophecy","main2":"Fool of Prophecy","main3":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main4":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main5":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main6":"Spellbook Library of the Crescent","main7":"Spellbook Library of the Crescent","main8":"Spellbook Organization","main9":"Spellbook of Eternity","main10":"Spellbook of Eternity","main11":"Spellbook of Fate","main12":"Spellbook of Fate","main13":"Spellbook of Fate","main14":"Spellbook of Power","main15":"Spellbook of Secrets","main16":"Spellbook of Secrets","main17":"Spellbook of Secrets","main18":"Spellbook of the Master","main19":"Spellbook of the Master","main20":"Spellbook of the Master","main21":"Treacherous Trap Hole","date":"2018-05-16T15:42:44.142Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
