Everyone knows the deck by now so won't labor, but found this build to be the most well rounded. Good on first turn with Saffira and on T2 with OTKs. Don't like the giving the extra resource with Standby especially as the eternal Kuriboh starts to emerge back in the meta. Deck seldomly bricked even with two trunades in balance and led to a turn 2  OTK with Trunade close to 50% of the time when going 2nd. Highly recommend, also would like to test Bacon in lieu of one Petit, more D for the few times you do brick.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main2":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main3":"Cyber Angel Benten","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main7":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main10":"Cyber Petit Angel","main11":"Cyber Petit Angel","main12":"Hymn of Light","main13":"Hymn of Light","main14":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main15":"Machine Angel Ritual","main16":"Sprite's Blessing","main17":"Sprite's Blessing","main18":"Hey, Trunade!","main19":"Hey, Trunade!","date":"2018-04-04T20:18:14.511Z","timestamp":1522873094,"layout":"post"}
