Boss monsters every turn! Lyla is a nice tech for a free spell removal to set up emperor OTK's. I originally didnt like needle bug but with restart you need atleast 1 needle bug in your starting hand for the the most consistent plays (fiend griefing works if you know its masked heroes, sylvan, or CA). 3 cavalry is a must to use Roar, 2 empress is a must (3 is doable). I'd rate this deck a 7/10 for performance but 9/10 for fun. Very few tilt matches except when needle bug tosses 3CoA and 2 Roar in the GY. gg ez claps","main0":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main1":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main2":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main3":"Archfiend Empress","main4":"Archfiend Empress","main5":"Archfiend Cavalry","main6":"Archfiend Cavalry","main7":"Archfiend Cavalry","main8":"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress","main9":"Archfiend's Roar","main10":"Archfiend's Roar","main11":"Archfiend's Roar","main12":"Fiend Griefing","main13":"Fiend Griefing","main14":"Needlebug Nest","main15":"Needlebug Nest","main16":"Needlebug Nest","main17":"Call of the Archfiend","main18":"Call of the Archfiend","main19":"Call of the Archfiend","date":"2018-04-18T03:53:53.205Z","timestamp":1524023633}
