Found this masterpiece combining GB with Weevil and just adapted it to what I think is the optimized version of it. Really strong, consistent and fun to play with. Played like 20 games and just 1 brick that ended in a win, since even when you brick you can still comeback.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","main1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","main2":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","main3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","main4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","main5":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main7":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main8":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main9":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main10":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main11":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main12":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main13":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main14":"Cosmic Cyclone","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Half Shut","main18":"Half Shut","main19":"Curse of Anubis","main20":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main21":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main22":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main23":"Impenetrable Attack","main24":"Mirror Wall","date":"2017-12-17T05:24:36.060Z"}
