TBH Amazons are pretty consistent as they are and FITE lets you push lethal more frequently esp with your tiger plays, so restart is by no means necessary. I know for a fact the list isnt optimally tweaked cuz I wanted to jam more bastion proc'ers, but there's potential value if youre planning on running cyclone anyway. And thats 4 for 4, there's my KOG with each Bastion 1000 LP Skill. Your turn.\r\n\r\nAlso i woulda played psychics but psychics are not even close to fun to play\r\npapa corn beatdown woulda come before psychics","main0":"Amazoness Queen","main1":"Amazoness Paladin","main2":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main3":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main4":"Amazoness Sage","main5":"Amazoness Princess","main6":"Amazoness Princess","main7":"Amazoness Princess","main8":"Amazoness Baby Tiger","main9":"Amazoness Baby Tiger","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Cosmic Cyclone","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Amazoness Onslaught","main15":"Amazoness Onslaught","main16":"Amazoness Onslaught","main17":"Amazoness Willpower","main18":"Mirror Wall","main19":"Mirror Wall","date":"2018-05-13T07:09:46.563Z","layout":"post","message":" ","tags":["comment-subscription"],"timestamp":1526195386}
