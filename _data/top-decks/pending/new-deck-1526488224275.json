I encountered quite some Ojama/Extra Extra Burn decks but weirdly never lost once (even when my opponent summoned 3 Lava golems to my side) , so even though it's supposed to be a hard matchup, there is still room for plays which can make you win the game, which is why I love this deck. I still find myself noticing small misplays so I can still learn more about the deck (which isn't the case with more braindead decks.. looking at you sylvans)","main0":"Amazoness Queen","main1":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main2":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main3":"Amazoness Sage","main4":"Amazoness Sage","main5":"Amazoness Princess","main6":"Amazoness Princess","main7":"Amazoness Princess","main8":"Amazoness Baby Tiger","main9":"Amazoness Baby Tiger","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Forbidden Chalice","main14":"Amazoness Onslaught","main15":"Amazoness Onslaught","main16":"Amazoness Onslaught","main17":"Amazoness Willpower","main18":"Powerful Rebirth","main19":"Powerful Rebirth","date":"2018-05-16T16:30:24.274Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
