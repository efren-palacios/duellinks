Been playing 2 months and have gotten KoG both months because of Slash and nothing else. It is literally the only deck I have put together so far as I am broke. Expensive deck for being broke right? I got lucky. This deck probably cost about $50-60 (a lot for the Blazemen).     Little variations worth mentioning:     1x Elemental Hero Neos (for Blazeman effect)      1x Cosmic Cyclone (for SSA and general back row)","main0":"Red-Eyes Wyvern","main1":"Elemental HERO Blazeman","main2":"Elemental HERO Blazeman","main3":"Elemental HERO Blazeman","main4":"King of the Swamp","main5":"King of the Swamp","main6":"Elemental HERO Neos","main7":"Red-Eyes B.
