Same as last season more or less, subbed Swain for a Oak, Knights for a Carrot and Lover, and Trunade for Chalice.\r\n\r\nOn that topic - Chalice is probably better than Ultimate Providence to me for Sylvans. Yes, it doesn't destroy, but that doesn't matter too much since I've always found myself topdecking anyhow in prolonged matches (and if you topdeck this? not as bad as topdecking providence). I was happy of the tech choice and it saved me multiple times. Considered slipping a 2nd in, but never got around to it as I didn't know what to sub.","main0":"Sylvan Hermitree","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Hermitree","main3":"Sylvan Guardioak","main4":"Sylvan Guardioak","main5":"World Carrotweight Champion","main6":"World Carrotweight Champion","main7":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main8":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main9":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main10":"Rose Lover","main11":"Rose Lover","main12":"Rose Lover","main13":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main14":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main15":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Enemy Controller","main18":"Forbidden Chalice","main19":"Hey, Trunade!","date":"2018-04-06T04:33:23.188Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
