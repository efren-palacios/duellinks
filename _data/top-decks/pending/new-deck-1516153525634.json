I was hoping for bamboo shit to end, but unfortunately it looks that it will hold until the end of the season....\r\n\r\nThis decks was working fine... Only real problems I got with this was hazy and 3sd ninja, but econs can be changed for srh to help that. For the other decks in general, I think this build can work around then.","main0":"The Six Samurai - Zanji","main1":"The Six Samurai - Zanji","main2":"The Six Samurai - Zanji","main3":"The Six Samurai - Irou","main4":"Hand of the Six Samurai","main5":"Hand of the Six Samurai","main6":"Hand of the Six Samurai","main7":"The Six Samurai - Yaichi","main8":"The Six Samurai - Yaichi","main9":"The Six Samurai - Yaichi","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Forbidden Chalice","main13":"Curse of Anubis","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Mirror Wall","main17":"Mirror Wall","main18":"Powerful Rebirth","main19":"Powerful Rebirth","date":"2018-01-17T01:45:25.634Z","timestamp":1516153525,"id":"{@id}"}
