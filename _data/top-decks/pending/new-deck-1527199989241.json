I used 8 different versions of the deck, and this was by far the best. 2x of Amulet and Wetlands was the best way to brick. Honestly, could have ran 1 more Witch and still been great. 3x Canadia was a huge asset, and if I had another Hallucigenia I would have run it. Hallowed Life Barrier is the most broken card in this deck, since you guarantee live for a turn, can discard a Paleo and special summon the same card, and you are safe from cards under the effect of Rose Lover. Chain Reaction was amazing and actually won me my rank up versus Amazoness, which is by far the most difficult match up. Can I be an expert for Paleozoics now?","main0":"Vision HERO Witch Raider","main1":"Amulet of Ambition","main2":"Amulet of Ambition","main3":"Wetlands","main4":"Wetlands","main5":"Curse of Anubis","main6":"Hallowed Life Barrier","main7":"Hallowed Life Barrier","main8":"Paleozoic Canadia","main9":"Paleozoic Canadia","main10":"Paleozoic Canadia","main11":"Paleozoic Hallucigenia","main12":"Paleozoic Marrella","main13":"Paleozoic Marrella","main14":"Paleozoic Pikaia","main15":"Paleozoic Pikaia","main16":"Paleozoic Pikaia","main17":"Wall of Disruption","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","timestamp":1527199989,"date":"2018-05-24T22:13:09.241Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
