Hey, Trunade! was for the going-second approach, Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell for the going-first.\r\nSide note: I couldn't help using Arkana's Restart with this deck to attach the theme to him","main0":"Prophecy Destroyer","main1":"Reaper of Prophecy","main2":"Reaper of Prophecy","main3":"The Tricky","main4":"Magical Something","main5":"Fool of Prophecy","main6":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main7":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main8":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Hey, Trunade!","main11":"Monster Gate","main12":"Spellbook Library of the Crescent","main13":"Spellbook Library of the Crescent","main14":"Spellbook of Eternity","main15":"Spellbook of Eternity","main16":"Spellbook of Fate","main17":"Spellbook of Fate","main18":"Spellbook of Fate","main19":"Spellbook of Life","main20":"Spellbook of Power","main21":"Spellbook of Secrets","main22":"Spellbook of Secrets","main23":"Spellbook of Secrets","main24":"Spellbook of the Master","main25":"Spellbook of the Master","main26":"That Grass Looks Greener","main27":"That Grass Looks Greener","main28":"That Grass Looks Greener","main29":"Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell","date":"2018-05-02T23:57:23.630Z","tags":[]}
