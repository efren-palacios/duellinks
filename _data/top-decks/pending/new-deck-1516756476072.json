Forget anyone who runs floodgate and disruption. I was stuck in plat 5 for around 100 games for some reason with the standard red eyes build for beat down. I finally got out and then had a smooth ride to legend 3 then starting dealing with a lot of control. I tried using Ross' tournament Phoenix build to deal with the back row but I found myself either bricking or dying too quickly/ not having the tools to close certain matchups. I got sick of it and decided to stop respecting people's back row since most of the time playing around things that aren't there can put you at a disadvantage. Lo and behold a few SMorc games later and I'm KoG.\r\nTy @Anthoknee , @Insano - REZ Expert and @Ross for the help!\r\n\r\nBtw ran 3 red eyes for maximum one shot potential with gozuki combos.","main0":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main1":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main2":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main3":"Gozuki","main4":"Gozuki","main5":"Gozuki","main6":"Samurai Skull","main7":"Samurai Skull","main8":"Bacon Saver","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Red-Eyes Insight","main12":"Red-Eyes Insight","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Super Rush Headlong","main15":"Red-Eyes Spirit","main16":"Red-Eyes Spirit","main17":"Xing Zhen Hu","main18":"Xing Zhen Hu","main19":"Xing Zhen Hu","date":"2018-01-24T01:14:36.072Z"}
