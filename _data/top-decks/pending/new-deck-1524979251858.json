Reached KoG for the first time last month with Sylvans and happy to run it back with Sylvans this month. KoG rank up was against restart DM who was too slow to keep up with Sylvans. Inspired by some of the top KC Cup decks, I tried this build to not worry about restarting. Grit worked for me as many times as grit had failed me. Fragrance is a nice tech, but easily the weakest card in my deck and could probably be replaced by an UP.","main0":"Sylvan Hermitree","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Guardioak","main3":"Sylvan Guardioak","main4":"Sylvan Guardioak","main5":"World Carrotweight Champion","main6":"World Carrotweight Champion","main7":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main8":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main9":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main10":"Rose Lover","main11":"Rose Lover","main12":"Rose Lover","main13":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main14":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main15":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Enemy Controller","main18":"Enemy Controller","main19":"Fragrance Storm","date":"2018-04-29T05:20:51.858Z","pageless":true,"templateKey":"comments","tags":[]}
