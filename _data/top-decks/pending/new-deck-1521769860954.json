Finally picked up my 3rd Emperor and absolutely dominated. Went 15-1 with this deck in an hour\r\n\r\nDominates Sylvans by destroying their facedown monsters with Emperor. That's enough to win a majority of games on the ladder. I literally never lost to them.\r\nI would have trouble facing SSA or Red Eyes Slash, but other than that this deck is extremely powerful with its combination of:\r\n- destroying any card on the field\r\n- high serchability of the deck\r\n- being able to special summon boss monsters frequently for game/swinging around WoD\r\n\r\nHowever, I played this deck in the Meta Weekly 12 today and was swiftly knocked out game one due to double hard bricks which was unfortunate. \r\nHowever I faced turn 1 RESlash both games and that single card is very strong against this deck as it shuts down Emperors effect. \r\nSo I'd like to keep testing this deck out in the Weekly's to see if it has any tournament viability.\r\nSo bricking can still be an issue, even though I rarely bricked on my climb and when I did with an all trap hand, I still won that game (against Sylvans)","main0":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main1":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main2":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main3":"Archfiend Empress","main4":"Trance Archfiend","main5":"Trance Archfiend","main6":"Trance Archfiend","main7":"Doomdog Octhros","main8":"Doomdog Octhros","main9":"Doomdog Octhros","main10":"Advance Draw","main11":"Advance Draw","main12":"Card of the Soul","main13":"Card of the Soul","main14":"Card of the Soul","main15":"Escape from the Dark Dimension","main16":"Wall of Disruption","main17":"Call of the Archfiend","main18":"Call of the Archfiend","main19":"Call of the Archfiend","date":"2018-03-23T01:51:00.954Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
