But kept facing CA 5 times in a row, at which point, I knew I had to switch to Destiny Draw Burn.\r\nTwo key components in this deck was rabbits and Xing Zhen Hu. This is especially important when facing a mirror match or Weevil burn deck because rabbits return to your hand even if your opponents massivemorph them, meaning they can't summon lava golem. Also, Xing Zhen Hu practically makes their backrow useless.","main0":"Lava Golem","main1":"Lava Golem","main2":"Skystarray","main3":"Sphere Kuriboh","main4":"Inaba White Rabbit","main5":"Inaba White Rabbit","main6":"Inaba White Rabbit","main7":"Cosmic Cyclone","main8":"Emergency Provisions","main9":"Supremacy Berry","main10":"Temple of the Mind's Eye","main11":"Temple of the Mind's Eye","main12":"Temple of the Mind's Eye","main13":"Aegis of Gaia","main14":"Draining Shield","main15":"Draining Shield","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main18":"Massivemorph","main19":"Massivemorph","main20":"Massivemorph","main21":"Xing Zhen Hu","date":"2017-12-24T03:28:51.021Z","timestamp":1514086131}
