Tried Magical Marionette, it was not as good as I thought. Finally decided to run 3 fool 2 crescent for the turn 1 reaper combo. I run 2 destroyer and 1 reaper, because the chance they are milled to GY is greater than the chance they are drawed, and destroyer in GY is so much better then reaper in GY. I almost never want to draw either destroyer or reaper.\r\nI also tried the tricky. It never helped me, and I always want a fool or destoryer instead.","main0":"Prophecy Destroyer","main1":"Prophecy Destroyer","main2":"Reaper of Prophecy","main3":"Fool of Prophecy","main4":"Fool of Prophecy","main5":"Fool of Prophecy","main6":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main7":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main8":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main9":"Spellbook Library of the Crescent","main10":"Spellbook Library of the Crescent","main11":"Spellbook of Eternity","main12":"Spellbook of Eternity","main13":"Spellbook of Eternity","main14":"Spellbook of Fate","main15":"Spellbook of Fate","main16":"Spellbook of Fate","main17":"Spellbook of Life","main18":"Spellbook of Life","main19":"Spellbook of Power","main20":"Spellbook of Secrets","main21":"Spellbook of Secrets","main22":"Spellbook of Secrets","main23":"Spellbook of the Master","main24":"Spellbook of the Master","main25":"Spellbook of the Master","main26":"That Grass Looks Greener","main27":"That Grass Looks Greener","main28":"That Grass Looks Greener","main29":"Treacherous Trap Hole","date":"2018-05-13T07:16:17.668Z","layout":"post","message":" ","tags":["comment-subscription"],"timestamp":1526195777}
