Creature Seizure was amazing. Literally won so many games on its own. Personally I wouldn't recommend 3 Gifts, even though you see that a lot. Even with 2 Knights you don't really have enough fodder for them AND your other important board control cards. Feng felt clunky at times, but amazing at others (KoG rankup match for example). Regulation of the Tribe did work, and was suprisingly effective vs Burn, but is also the card I would probably cut first.","main0":"Knight of the Red Lotus","main1":"Knight of the Red Lotus","main2":"The Agent of Creation - Venus","main3":"The Agent of Creation - Venus","main4":"The Agent of Creation - Venus","main5":"Fenghuang","main6":"Mystical Shine Ball","main7":"Mystical Shine Ball","main8":"Mystical Shine Ball","main9":"Creature Seizure","main10":"Creature Seizure","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Order to Charge","main15":"Transmodify","main16":"White Elephant's Gift","main17":"White Elephant's Gift","main18":"Curse of Anubis","main19":"The Regulation of Tribe","date":"2017-12-27T23:15:29.256Z","timestamp":1514416529}
