I tried to hit KOG with shadow game glad beats and failed miserably so I went back to CA but i could not get that 5th kog game and got de ranked to leg 2. So i switched to our \"tier 1\" deck and I was able to hit kog with around 11 games. Kog rank up match was the mirror, but he misplayed by wasting his 2 econs and trying to go for gg and he forgot i had some good bacon in the graveyard.","main0":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main1":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main2":"Red-Eyes Wyvern","main3":"Gozuki","main4":"Gozuki","main5":"Samurai Skull","main6":"Samurai Skull","main7":"Samurai Skull","main8":"Bacon Saver","main9":"Anti-Magic Arrows","main10":"Anti-Magic Arrows","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Red-Eyes Insight","main14":"Red-Eyes Insight","main15":"Red-Eyes Insight","main16":"Super Rush Headlong","main17":"Super Rush Headlong","main18":"Red-Eyes Spirit","main19":"Red-Eyes Spirit","date":"2018-01-26T17:46:29.899Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
