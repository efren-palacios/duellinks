IMO, I'll rate restart>balance>mindscan for this particular deck list. Because brick is real in mind scan. As for balance, I would suggest running 3 senjus + 2 petit. \r\nGyokkou comes in handy against most of the current meta decks *be sure to activate it before summoning.\r\nXing zhen hu helps alot in locking down tight back row too.\r\nThis is a deck where you'll have a high % in OTK-ing early game.\r\nSpecial thanks to Negative1 - CA Expert  for skill and techs suggestions^^ thank you senpai","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main2":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main3":"Cyber Angel Benten","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main7":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Cyber Petit Angel","main10":"Cyber Petit Angel","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Fire Formation - Gyokkou","main13":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main14":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main15":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main16":"Machine Angel Ritual","main17":"Sprite's Blessing","main18":"Sprite's Blessing","main19":"Xing Zhen Hu","date":"2017-12-24T03:13:42.218Z","timestamp":1514085222}
