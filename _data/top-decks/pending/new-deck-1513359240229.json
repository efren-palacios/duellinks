Cyclone was a late edition due to ninja frequency and it saved me a couple times. I was also kind of surprised how much work Herk and BatMan put in. Herk was mvp for burn matches, BatMan for the mirror matches. Harambe usually only showed up in emergencies. Back row speaks for itself.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","main1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","main2":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","main3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","main4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","main5":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main7":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main8":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main9":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main10":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main11":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main12":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main13":"Cosmic Cyclone","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Forbidden Chalice","main18":"Half Shut","main19":"Half Shut","main20":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main21":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main22":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main23":"Impenetrable Attack","main24":"Impenetrable Attack","date":"2017-12-15T17:34:00.228Z","timestamp":1513359240}
