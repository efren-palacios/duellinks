Was L3 since first week thanks to Masked Heroes, chilled off ranked and hopped in today just to test a Ninja idea that came to mind\r\nNotebook is the core card, you wanna see it every game. Mauso enables the big Ninjas similar to what 3sd did. RDN is disruptive and the main boss, BDN can still win games out of nowhere, SSN is worse than before but can be clutch. Sazank was the card I was testing, fun to Dupe into and a good answer for Anki ideally.","main0":"Black Dragon Ninja","main1":"Red Dragon Ninja","main2":"Red Dragon Ninja","main3":"Red Dragon Ninja","main4":"Senior Silver Ninja","main5":"Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke","main6":"Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke","main7":"Karakuri Ninja mdl 339 \"Sazank\"","main8":"Karakuri Ninja mdl 339 \"Sazank\"","main9":"Masked Ninja Ebisu","main10":"Masked Ninja Ebisu","main11":"Armor Ninjitsu Art of Alchemy","main12":"Mausoleum of the Emperor","main13":"Mausoleum of the Emperor","main14":"Ninjitsu Art Notebook","main15":"Ninjitsu Art Notebook","main16":"Ninjitsu Art Notebook","main17":"Ninjitsu Art of Duplication","main18":"Ninjitsu Art of Duplication","main19":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","main20":"Ninjitsu Art of Transformation","date":"2018-04-22T16:35:00.195Z"}
