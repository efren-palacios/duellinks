Ninjas were pretty easy if you play around their hand count. CA is dumb easy. AG was a cake walk so was burn. The only tough match up was the mirror match.  Tier 2 for the win. Props to swordfish111 for instilling faith in me with the holy guard it got I went on a huge streak to legend 3 then used mind scan the last 2 just to make sure I didn’t misplay.. I don’t own a 3rd laquari or floodgate so don’t ask.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Sphere Kuriboh","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Half Shut","main13":"Curse of Anubis","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Impenetrable Attack","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Lightforce Sword","main19":"Windstorm of Etaqua","date":"2017-12-16T17:03:32.384Z"}
