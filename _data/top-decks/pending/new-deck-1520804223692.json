If it gets stopped, it's another turn stall. \r\nInverse universe turns your 600/2400 Jasmine into a 2400/600 monster. And since you can activate it during damage step, they lose a monster and take around 2000 damage depending on the monster. Especially helpful against gladiators since they think they are protected when attacking a Jasmine. The delays also makes them think it's an econ.(edited)\r\nRosemary's effect of monster effect negation is actually great against aliens, since Alien Warrior and Alien kid effects depend on being flipped or destroyed. Also since the back row can be activated anytime, Alien telepath removal isn't that big of a deal.","main0":"Aromage Rosemary","main1":"Aromage Rosemary","main2":"Aromage Rosemary","main3":"Rose Archer","main4":"Rose Archer","main5":"Skystarray","main6":"Skystarray","main7":"Aromage Jasmine","main8":"Aromage Jasmine","main9":"Aromage Jasmine","main10":"Aroma Garden","main11":"Aroma Garden","main12":"Aroma Garden","main13":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main14":"Inverse Universe","main15":"Inverse Universe","main16":"Inverse Universe","main17":"The Spell Absorbing Life","main18":"The Spell Absorbing Life","main19":"The Spell Absorbing Life","date":"2018-03-11T21:37:03.691Z","timestamp":1520804223}
