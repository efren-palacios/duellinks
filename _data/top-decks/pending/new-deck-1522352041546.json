In my experience I would have my combo first turn a lot of the time.  Sylvans were easy since most of the time they just set 1 monster and end, at that point it's a free win. At one point I had 4 OTK's in a row vs sylvans before getting cucked on kog rank up. If you brick it's basically over.","main0":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main1":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main2":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main3":"Dark Necrofear","main4":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main5":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main6":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main7":"Trance Archfiend","main8":"Trance Archfiend","main9":"Trance Archfiend","main10":"Broww, Huntsman of Dark World","main11":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main12":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main13":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main14":"Dark World Dealings","main15":"Dark World Dealings","main16":"Dark World Dealings","main17":"Dark World Lightning","main18":"Dark World Lightning","main19":"Dark World Lightning","date":"2018-03-29T19:34:01.546Z","timestamp":1522352041546}
