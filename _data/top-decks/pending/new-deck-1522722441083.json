I wanted to have fun, playing Sylvans and it was great from P4 till L2. And then I faced A WHOLE LOAD OF CYBER ANGELS NO-BRAIN DECKS, like... 10 in a row? So I switched to aliens and lost only twice - to Whale and to Sylvans. Interesting, that I never used WOD, so better swap it for Super Rush Headlong or Forbidden Chalice, to Counter better Whale or Sylvans\r\n\r\nSkill is Balance","main0":"Alien Overlord","main1":"Alien Warrior","main2":"Alien Warrior","main3":"Alien Warrior","main4":"Alien Telepath","main5":"Alien Telepath","main6":"Alien Telepath","main7":"Alien Grey","main8":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main9":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main10":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Brainwashing Beam","main15":"Brainwashing Beam","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-04-03T02:27:21.082Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
