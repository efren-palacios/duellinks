So I thought take it out and go on the backrow hunt.\r\n1). People aren't expecting backrow like Xing and Gyokkou with glads so they play around you drawing a Bestiari like a normal Glad deck.\r\n2). I have 3 Laquari but the deck plays on fast  aggression with Econ and Dimacari, I found it worked best With 2 and 2 Electro. \r\n3). Also Laquari gets a boost from Gyokkou so runs well into the mirror match - the downside is you rarely get out Batman and Heraklinos..\r\nJust wanted to try something different this season and this was super fun to play..","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Sergeant Electro","main5":"Sergeant Electro","main6":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Enemy Controller","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Fire Formation - Gyokkou","main12":"Fire Formation - Gyokkou","main13":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Impenetrable Attack","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Impenetrable Attack","main19":"Xing Zhen Hu","extra0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","extra1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","extra2":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","date":"2018-02-12T12:29:12.541Z"}
