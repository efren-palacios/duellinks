Primal cry in the grave also allows you to just activate dakinis effect even if you think they have econ, since dakini will just be revived at the end of the turn. Vennu's effect is also stupidly good with the deck now since you need exact levels besides primal cry. The plays you can make are amazing.","main0":"Vennu, Bright Bird of Divinity","main1":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main2":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main3":"Cyber Angel Benten","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main7":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main10":"Sonic Bird","main11":"Sonic Bird","main12":"Cyber Petit Angel","main13":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main14":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main15":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main16":"Primal Cry","main17":"Sprite's Blessing","main18":"Sprite's Blessing","main19":"Sprite's Blessing","date":"2018-01-15T13:24:38.860Z"}
