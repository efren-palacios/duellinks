It really lifted my spirits after tilting from KOG rank up to L1 with both Aliens and Sylvans. Pretty standard other than the parallel twister which came in clutch as one extra card destruction and is pretty much always live through Powerful Rebirth and Umi. Also my rank up match was against a glad beast player who Ultimate Providenced my Golden fish turn 3 when I thought I would have game. After that the duel literally lasted 20 minutes of back and forth board presence until the heart of the cards finally pulled through. Iâ€™ve never felt like I earned KOG more than that moment lol.","main0":"Golden Flying Fish","main1":"Golden Flying Fish","main2":"Golden Flying Fish","main3":"Hammer Shark","main4":"Hammer Shark","main5":"Hammer Shark","main6":"Oyster Meister","main7":"Oyster Meister","main8":"Oyster Meister","main9":"Beautunaful Princess","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Parallel Twister","main13":"Super Rush Headlong","main14":"Super Rush Headlong","main15":"Fish Depth Charge","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-03-23T17:26:07.516Z"}
