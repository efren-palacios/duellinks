This is an extremely inflated KoG since on my streak 2 opponents DC’d and my rank up match was literally against a 27 card SSA deck\r\nrn the best Bujin build imo is 30 cards with Grass and Ties, I own 0 Ties though so my build is firmly different. Lowered the deck to just 27 to draw Grass or Yamato more often, I don’t think the full 30 is necessary w/o Ties, tho a 28th card in a 3rd Sinyou or 1 Arasuda would work fine.","main0":"Bujin Hirume","main1":"Bujin Hirume","main2":"Bujin Mikazuchi","main3":"Bujin Mikazuchi","main4":"Bujin Yamato","main5":"Bujin Yamato","main6":"Bujin Yamato","main7":"Bujingi Centipede","main8":"Bujingi Hare","main9":"Bujingi Hare","main10":"Bujingi Hare","main11":"Bujingi Turtle","main12":"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress","main13":"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress","main14":"Bujingi Quilin","main15":"Bujingi Quilin","main16":"Bujingi Sinyou","main17":"Bujingi Sinyou","main18":"That Grass Looks Greener","main19":"That Grass Looks Greener","main20":"That Grass Looks Greener","main21":"Divine Wrath","main22":"Divine Wrath","main23":"Divine Wrath","main24":"Powerful Rebirth","main25":"Powerful Rebirth","main26":"Ultimate Providence","timestamp":1527207459,"date":"2018-05-25T00:17:39.120Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
