Mythic Depths as the skill wasn't consistent enough for me. I saw people saying how the deck dominates if it opens well enough, so I figured Balance would work well given the card type ratios, and boy was I right. Winrate skyrocketed when I switched to Balance and I highly recommend it to anyone having trouble with this deck. Something interesting was how often I would use E-Con defensively and then follow up with sniping things with Golden Flying Fish. It was a very effective play. 2 Mirror Wall was decently effective. There were games where it came in clutch when WoD wouldn't have and there were games where the 1 WoD was vastly superior to Mirror Wall. The extra deck never came into play, aside from maybe making people think I was playing Gladiators. On that note, however, I never hid what I was playing when I went first. I absolutely always summoned something in face-up attack and set protection behind it.","main0":"Golden Flying Fish","main1":"Golden Flying Fish","main2":"Golden Flying Fish","main3":"Hammer Shark","main4":"Hammer Shark","main5":"Hammer Shark","main6":"Oyster Meister","main7":"Oyster Meister","main8":"Oyster Meister","main9":"Beautunaful Princess","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Curse of Anubis","main14":"Fish Depth Charge","main15":"Mirror Wall","main16":"Mirror Wall","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Powerful Rebirth","main19":"Wall of Disruption","extra0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","extra1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","extra2":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","date":"2018-03-05T17:49:09.078Z"}
