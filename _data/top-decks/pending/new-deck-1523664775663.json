This deck is really consistent and powerful. Definitely worthy of being a tier 1 deck. \r\n\r\nI went from platinum 4 to legend undefeated and only suffered 4 losses while in legend. 3 of which were due to bad rng on my end and one due to clicking on a freshly summoned anchor instead of the one that was already on the board.\r\n\r\nThe only 2 things that I would change about the deck is replacing the 2 super rush headlong for one more ties of the brethren and forbidden chalice if I had them. Mainly because over half of my matches were against sylvans and being able to negate a komushroomo can be clutch to winning the match. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing about the deck.","main0":"Geargiattacker","main1":"Geargiattacker","main2":"Geargianchor","main3":"Geargianchor","main4":"Geargianchor","main5":"Geargiarsenal","main6":"Geargiarsenal","main7":"Geargiarsenal","main8":"Enemy Controller","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Forbidden Chalice","main11":"Super Rush Headlong","main12":"Super Rush Headlong","main13":"Ties of the Brethren","main14":"Curse of Anubis","main15":"Powerful Rebirth","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Pulse Mines","main18":"Pulse Mines","main19":"Pulse Mines","date":"2018-04-14T00:12:55.663Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
