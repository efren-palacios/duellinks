The deck struggled against CA and ninjas (unless the ninja player ran into mirror wall for no reason), but did surprisingly well against red-eyes and glads and decent against hazy. Before the CA nerf this deck struggled, but after the nerf it did pretty well and got me from legend 2 to kog in no time. Still wouldn't recommend this deck to climb though, i did it for the memes and because i like dark magician.","main0":"Skilled Dark Magician","main1":"Magician's Rod","main2":"Magician's Rod","main3":"Sergeant Electro","main4":"Sergeant Electro","main5":"Legion the Fiend Jester","main6":"Legion the Fiend Jester","main7":"Dark Magician","main8":"Dark Magician","main9":"Dark Magician","main10":"Ancient Rules","main11":"Ancient Rules","main12":"Dark Magic Attack","main13":"Dark Magic Curtain","main14":"Super Rush Headlong","main15":"Super Rush Headlong","main16":"Champion's Vigilance","main17":"Mirror Wall","main18":"Mirror Wall","main19":"Mirror Wall","date":"2018-01-10T19:24:27.340Z"}
