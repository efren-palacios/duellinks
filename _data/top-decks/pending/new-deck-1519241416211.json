Dragon destroyer or paladin shuts down Safirah CA. Hazy is too slow. Other slash decks got bodied  because of dragon destroyer.  Ultimate providence is a saving grace against a magnet player. Would add a 3rd slash and take out 2nd paladin.  Burn is near impossible if they get temple out before you get paladin.","main0":"Buster Blader","main1":"Buster Blader","main2":"Flame Armor Ninja","main3":"Earth Armor Ninja","main4":"Earth Armor Ninja","main5":"Elemental HERO Blazeman","main6":"Elemental HERO Blazeman","main7":"The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion","main8":"The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion","main9":"Red-Eyes B.
