I could've made it to KoG with 25 wins instead of 41 but lost 3 KoG promotions. 2 were against stall burn and 1 backrow-hate dinosaurs.\r\n\r\nThe best part about the deck was when I stole saffira by brainwash and used its effect (did it many times during my climb). Also, i'd like to thank WoD for making people surrender.","main0":"Alien Overlord","main1":"Alien Warrior","main2":"Alien Warrior","main3":"Alien Warrior","main4":"Alien Telepath","main5":"Alien Telepath","main6":"Alien Telepath","main7":"Alien Grey","main8":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main9":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main10":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Brainwashing Beam","main15":"Brainwashing Beam","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-03-03T22:40:21.072Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
