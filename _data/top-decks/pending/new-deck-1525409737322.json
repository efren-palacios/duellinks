I changed to this and chaos hunters becoming a meta call it was a breeze after legend 2; Lost only once. 15 wins to legend using a more standard list with invaders but got tilted a lot in legend adjusting to the meta. Archfiends are tier 0 when you donâ€™t brick. Most of the wins after legend 2 with this current list were surrenders. Hilarious.","main0":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main1":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main2":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main3":"Archfiend Empress","main4":"Archfiend Empress","main5":"Archfiend Empress","main6":"Chaos Hunter","main7":"Chaos Hunter","main8":"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress","main9":"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress","main10":"Snipe Hunter","main11":"Archfiend's Roar","main12":"Archfiend's Roar","main13":"Archfiend's Roar","main14":"Call of the Archfiend","main15":"Call of the Archfiend","main16":"Call of the Archfiend","main17":"Needlebug Nest","main18":"Needlebug Nest","main19":"Paleozoic Canadia","date":"2018-05-04T04:55:37.321Z","tags":[],"pageless":true,"templateKey":"comments","timestamp":1525409737,"layout":"post","message":" "}
