The econs and FTHs are there to deal with CA, bamboo and sometimes ninjas but also were great against hazy. Otherwise the other decks were traditional burn decks which is where Dark Magic Attack and electro help out a lot. Looking forward to using this deck after the nerfs, but glad I got to steal KoG early with this.","main0":"Skilled Dark Magician","main1":"Magician's Rod","main2":"Magician's Rod","main3":"Sergeant Electro","main4":"Sergeant Electro","main5":"Legion the Fiend Jester","main6":"Legion the Fiend Jester","main7":"Dark Magician","main8":"Dark Magician","main9":"Dark Magician","main10":"Ancient Rules","main11":"Ancient Rules","main12":"Dark Magic Attack","main13":"Dark Magic Curtain","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Thousand Knives","main17":"Champion's Vigilance","main18":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main19":"Floodgate Trap Hole","date":"2018-01-05T18:13:21.728Z"}
