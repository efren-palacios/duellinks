Focusing on Abyss Soldier and Hammer Shark maximises your chance of summoning Whale turn 1 (Abyss Soldier can pitch Fishborg to bounce Umi, and Fishborg can then revive itself for a Whale play). Abyss Soldier is a stellar card going first or second as it gives you more access to Whale while also giving you an out to practically any card in the game and sometimes winning whole games by itself. One ALO to insulate yourself from Cosmic Cyclone to a degree, and the level reduction sometimes comes in clutch.  Hammer Shark + Warrior of Atlantis is exactly 4k under Umi, and E-Con + Fishborg opens up a lot of OTK potential. E-con also dominates in the Oyster, SSA and CA match-ups. 2 SSA because you want to search it with Whale rather than draw it in your first hand, and most people will usually target your Umi with Cyclone anyway.","main0":"Citadel Whale","main1":"Citadel Whale","main2":"Citadel Whale","main3":"Warrior of Atlantis","main4":"Abyss Soldier","main5":"Abyss Soldier","main6":"Abyss Soldier","main7":"Hammer Shark","main8":"Hammer Shark","main9":"Hammer Shark","main10":"Fishborg Planter","main11":"Fishborg Planter","main12":"Fishborg Planter","main13":"Beautunaful Princess","main14":"A Legendary Ocean","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Enemy Controller","main18":"Sea Stealth Attack","main19":"Sea Stealth Attack","extra0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","extra1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","extra2":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","date":"2018-03-07T03:05:46.479Z"}
