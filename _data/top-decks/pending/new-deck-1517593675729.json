I felt that enemy controller was too important this season because of the renaissance of cyber angels in the ladder. With the angels, D.draw burn came back; even though it was never a problem for gladiators it still led to long, annoying games. I barely faced ancient gears and their electros, so wall of d and impenetrable attack gained a lot of value. The most original deck I faced was during my win streak for kog where I met this Japanese player running  snipe hunter with ananta. During turn 2 he destroyed my monster with snipe hunter dumping a reptile and used the said reptile to  summon ananta. He had lynx to replenish his hand and fuel the sniper.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Enemy Controller","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Fire Formation - Gyokkou","main12":"Super Rush Headlong","main13":"Curse of Anubis","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Impenetrable Attack","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","extra0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","extra1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","extra2":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","date":"2018-02-02T17:47:55.729Z","commentDate":"2018-02-02T17:47:55.729Z","timestamp":1517593675,"layout":"post"}
