Only change made was -1 senju +1 sprite's to test and it consistency raised a lot(almost never bricked or was unable to comeback back) Not using trunade since it drops consistency and faced a few decks with heavy backrow and almost 0 WoD. Providence was a little annoying but no big problems to play around it. Gishiki chan is really amazing the true MVP in many games.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main2":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main3":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Gishki Chain","main7":"Gishki Chain","main8":"Gishki Chain","main9":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main10":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main11":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main12":"Cyber Petit Angel","main13":"Hymn of Light","main14":"Hymn of Light","main15":"Hymn of Light","main16":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main17":"Machine Angel Ritual","main18":"Sprite's Blessing","main19":"Sprite's Blessing","date":"2018-04-10T23:18:45.803Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
