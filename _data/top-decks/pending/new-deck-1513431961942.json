This deck is good yes and has a lot of plays and great monsters but it biggest weak point is that every deck that is played has some sort of way to counter you think about econ every deck in this game plays econ or it has to be a special deck that has like massive morph or flood hole trap  thing. Don't give up on this deck yet go and wait for the new banlist etc to see what their plans are for this deck/archtype","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main2":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main3":"Cyber Angel Benten","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main7":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Sonic Bird","main10":"Sonic Bird","main11":"Cyber Petit Angel","main12":"Cyber Petit Angel","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main16":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main17":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main18":"Machine Angel Ritual","main19":"Sprite's Blessing","date":"2017-12-16T13:46:01.942Z"}
