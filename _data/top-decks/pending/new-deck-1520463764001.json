From the Kc cup to the new box releasing viable decks or empowering other deck types. I climbed from legend 1-3 with destiny board but with a different build. Some decks I didn't live long enough for the 5 turns so I switched to fiend farewell. Really good matchups across the board. Hardest matchup were hazy and sea stealth if they get the combo going.","main0":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main1":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main2":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main3":"Lava Golem","main4":"Dark Necrofear","main5":"Dark Necrofear","main6":"Trance Archfiend","main7":"Trance Archfiend","main8":"Trance Archfiend","main9":"Doomdog Octhros","main10":"Doomdog Octhros","main11":"Doomdog Octhros","main12":"Sphere Kuriboh","main13":"Sphere Kuriboh","main14":"Question","main15":"Question","main16":"Question","main17":"Escape from the Dark Dimension","main18":"Escape from the Dark Dimension","main19":"Wall of Disruption","main20":"Wall of Disruption","main21":"Xing Zhen Hu","date":"2018-03-07T23:02:44.000Z","tags":["routart"],"layout":"post","timestamp":1520463764}
