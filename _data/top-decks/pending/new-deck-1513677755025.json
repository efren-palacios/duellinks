Found this masterpiece combining GB with Weevil watching Uchiha Leandro YT channel and just adapted it to what I think is the optimized version of it. Really strong, consistent and fun to play with. Played like 20 games and just 1 brick that ended in a win, since even when you brick u can still comeback.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Dimacari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Half Shut","main13":"Half Shut","main14":"Curse of Anubis","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main18":"Impenetrable Attack","main19":"Mirror Wall","date":"2017-12-19T10:02:35.024Z","timestamp":1513677755}
