For opponents with heavy backrow, it's all about starting defensively by prioritizing  Saffira (with protection and ideally partnered with a Senju on the field) to get your hands on Fenghuang asap. The main keys of this deck are its consistency and its ability to cycle through cards extremely fast, both from the deck and graveyard.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main2":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main3":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Benten","main7":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main10":"Cyber Petit Angel","main11":"Cyber Petit Angel","main12":"Fenghuang","main13":"Hymn of Light","main14":"Hymn of Light","main15":"Hymn of Light","main16":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main17":"Machine Angel Ritual","main18":"Sprite's Blessing","main19":"Sprite's Blessing","date":"2018-03-13T00:42:58.051Z","timestamp":1520901778,"tags":["comment-subscription"]}
