Was mostly just fueling for fun then got lucky and ranked up very fast. You all a know how glads work. The only thing I did differently was remove dimacari. Found myself wanting an 1800 laquari more often than a double attack dimacari. Went smooth for the most part, had one great duel vs weevil where I had to econ take his Amazoness, tributing my floodgated golem, which opened up my field enough to get out nerok, allowing me to destroy his burning land with 500 lp left on my side. He had no resources left and I was able to win after that move.","main0":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main1":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main2":"Gladiator Beast Laquari","main3":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main4":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main5":"Gladiator Beast Bestiari","main6":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main7":"Gladiator Beast Murmillo","main8":"Enemy Controller","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Super Rush Headlong","main11":"Super Rush Headlong","main12":"Curse of Anubis","main13":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Impenetrable Attack","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Windstorm of Etaqua","date":"2018-01-18T16:03:08.437Z","timestamp":1516291388}
