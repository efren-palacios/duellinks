The deck went through a whole lot of iterations, but this is what I ultimately settled on. The combination of xing, gyokkou, and cyclone are really good at shutting down things like glads, stall, REZ, AG, and Weevil burn. The econs are obviously there primarily to deal with CA. For a long time I was running 2 SRH, but once I realized that the only hazy I was running into was the beatdown variant and CA was a much larger threat, I decided to swap them out for WOD. Evilswarm was super clutch, allowing me to beat over REZ, Phoenix, unboosted Dakini, and unboosted Saffira. I personally think that this type of dino build is 10x better than electro builds. If you have any further questions just ask, I'll probably respond unless I don't feel like it.","main0":"Evilswarm Salamandra","main1":"Evilswarm Salamandra","main2":"Evilswarm Salamandra","main3":"Black Brachios","main4":"Black Brachios","main5":"Black Brachios","main6":"Hydrogeddon","main7":"Hydrogeddon","main8":"Hydrogeddon","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Fire Formation - Gyokkou","main15":"Fire Formation - Gyokkou","main16":"Wall of Disruption","main17":"Wall of Disruption","main18":"Xing Zhen Hu","main19":"Xing Zhen Hu","date":"2018-02-02T17:27:56.562Z","commentDate":"2018-02-02T17:27:56.562Z","timestamp":1517592476,"layout":"post"}
