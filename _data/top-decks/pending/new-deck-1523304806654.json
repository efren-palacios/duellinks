The fast wins against Archfiends, Sylvans and Water secured an easy KoG. Right now this deck has too many problems. Both Geargia and Masked HERO require a changed build because this one is consistent but not powerful enough to combat both Match-Ups. I tried different builds but they are either not powerful or not consistent enough to actually have a good winrate. While its not very good right now when I got KoG a week ago it was the best choice for the ladder.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main2":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main3":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Benten","main7":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main10":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main11":"Cyber Petit Angel","main12":"Cyber Petit Angel","main13":"Hymn of Light","main14":"Hymn of Light","main15":"Hymn of Light","main16":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main17":"Machine Angel Ritual","main18":"Sprite's Blessing","main19":"Sprite's Blessing","date":"2018-04-09T20:13:26.654Z"}
