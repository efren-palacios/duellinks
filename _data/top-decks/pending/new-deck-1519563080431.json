Its focused on synergizing with Ties of Brethren to swarm, and abusing abyss soldiers busted ass effect, which happens to easily win games. Fisherman, ALO, and Whale are just extras for when things get sticky. SSA is amazing with Abyss since you can protect forever. Chain helps setup Abyss plays or can grab a fisherman if you have ALO up.","main0":"Citadel Whale","main1":"The Legendary Fisherman II","main2":"The Legendary Fisherman II","main3":"Warrior of Atlantis","main4":"Warrior of Atlantis","main5":"Warrior of Atlantis","main6":"Abyss Soldier","main7":"Abyss Soldier","main8":"Abyss Soldier","main9":"Gishki Chain","main10":"Uminotaurus","main11":"A Legendary Ocean","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Super Rush Headlong","main16":"Ties of the Brethren","main17":"Sea Stealth Attack","main18":"Sea Stealth Attack","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-02-25T12:51:20.431Z"}
