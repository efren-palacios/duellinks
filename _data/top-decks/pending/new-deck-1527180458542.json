This deck went L1 to KOG. I found Econ pretty much useless. Subbed in wall of D instead, only problem was a rose lover'd Sylvan monster. Regular tiger was very handy. Also subbed in spy because I didn't have a 3rd swords women or any paladin or any sage (I'm kinda F2P, so don't spend money just Google play credit on $2 SR bundles). Also I wanted 1 other backrow hate card. Didn't think CCs cost was worth it double cyclone was meh. I literally had a game in legend where a masked hero player rage quit turn 3 after zing zen hu so I kept it after that.","main0":"Vision HERO Witch Raider","main1":"Amazoness Fighter","main2":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main3":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main4":"Amazoness Princess","main5":"Amazoness Princess","main6":"Amazoness Princess","main7":"Amazoness Tiger","main8":"Amazoness Spy","main9":"Amazoness Spy","main10":"Amazoness Baby Tiger","main11":"Forbidden Chalice","main12":"Amazoness Onslaught","main13":"Amazoness Onslaught","main14":"Amazoness Onslaught","main15":"Amazoness Willpower","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Wall of Disruption","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Xing Zhen Hu","timestamp":1527180458,"date":"2018-05-24T16:47:38.541Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
