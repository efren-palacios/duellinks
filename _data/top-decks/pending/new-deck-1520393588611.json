It has good match ups against all decks except Dinos. However, it still can win with an aggressive AMA play. Cosmic Cyclone is a great out to SSA decks and Brainwashing beam. If you have the 3rd powerfull rebirth play it instead of kurogane.","main0":"Valkyrion the Magna Warrior","main1":"Gaia Plate the Earth Giant","main2":"Gaia Plate the Earth Giant","main3":"Delta The Magnet Warrior","main4":"Delta The Magnet Warrior","main5":"Delta The Magnet Warrior","main6":"Beta The Electromagnet Warrior","main7":"Snipe Hunter","main8":"Beta The Magnet Warrior","main9":"Beta The Magnet Warrior","main10":"Beta The Magnet Warrior","main11":"Anti-Magic Arrows","main12":"Anti-Magic Arrows","main13":"Cosmic Cyclone","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Powerful Rebirth","main19":"Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane","date":"2018-03-07T03:33:08.610Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
