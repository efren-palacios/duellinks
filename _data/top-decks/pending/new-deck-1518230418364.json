Deck does pretty well against gb/dino/ca which I faced the most.  Current dino decks canâ€™t get over 2800 attack without backrow and ca just insta scoop vs paladin.  The deck gets destroyed by burn though but I was lucky enough to not run into many during the climb.","main0":"Buster Blader","main1":"Buster Blader","main2":"Buster Blader","main3":"Elemental HERO Blazeman","main4":"Elemental HERO Blazeman","main5":"Elemental HERO Blazeman","main6":"The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion","main7":"The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion","main8":"King of the Swamp","main9":"Red-Eyes B.
