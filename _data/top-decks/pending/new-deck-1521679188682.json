After testing nearly every variant of Archfiends I LIKE this one the most especially in ladder. The Dark world combos help with fish, cyber angels, glad beasts, sylvans, and mirror matches. LOTS OF OTK's. I used other decks like fish, CA, SSA, Hazy, and sylvans for comparison and got to KOG promo's but nothing powerhoused the ladder like this deck or the variant of Hey, Cyber Angels! (its busted) anyways maybe not for tournaments but for ranked ladder this deck is a top pick for fun and effectiveness imo. \r\n\r\nDarkworld dealings, archfiend empress, doom dog, and roar are all interchangeable for your playstyle imo 1-2 of any of them is best.","main0":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main1":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main2":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main3":"Archfiend Empress","main4":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main5":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main6":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main7":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main8":"Trance Archfiend","main9":"Trance Archfiend","main10":"Trance Archfiend","main11":"Doomdog Octhros","main12":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main13":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main14":"Dark World Dealings","main15":"Dark World Dealings","main16":"Archfiend's Roar","main17":"Call of the Archfiend","main18":"Call of the Archfiend","main19":"Call of the Archfiend","date":"2018-03-22T00:39:48.682Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
