Dark magician is working a lot better than last season for me, since i faced less cyber angels and gladiator beasts than last season, which were the toughest matchups imo.  Super rush was great vs aliens and sea stealth decks.","main0":"Magician's Rod","main1":"Magician's Rod","main2":"Sergeant Electro","main3":"Sergeant Electro","main4":"Sergeant Electro","main5":"Legion the Fiend Jester","main6":"Legion the Fiend Jester","main7":"Dark Magician","main8":"Dark Magician","main9":"Dark Magician","main10":"Ancient Rules","main11":"Ancient Rules","main12":"Dark Magic Attack","main13":"Dark Magic Curtain","main14":"Super Rush Headlong","main15":"Super Rush Headlong","main16":"Thousand Knives","main17":"Mirror Wall","main18":"Mirror Wall","main19":"Mirror Wall","date":"2018-03-07T05:27:53.672Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
