Throughout my seasons once starting with the REZ deck, brick draws were a nuisance and I really didn't see too many plays where I either had both monsters on the field or I needed a second REZD in my hand. Minus burn for the tribute and few situational plays, I didn't miss it much.\r\n\r\nThe Snipe and Storm can in handy for burn and several situations where I destroyed backrow with this meta. A 3/2 ratio with Gozuki and Skull works best for me. I originally had Wall of Ds for the Rushes, but I kept running into locking cards and pulling them when I didn't help to set.","main0":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main1":"Red-Eyes Wyvern","main2":"Gozuki","main3":"Gozuki","main4":"Gozuki","main5":"Samurai Skull","main6":"Samurai Skull","main7":"Snipe Hunter","main8":"Bacon Saver","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Red-Eyes Insight","main12":"Red-Eyes Insight","main13":"Red-Eyes Insight","main14":"Storm","main15":"Super Rush Headlong","main16":"Super Rush Headlong","main17":"Super Rush Headlong","main18":"Red-Eyes Spirit","main19":"Red-Eyes Spirit","date":"2018-03-11T01:32:58.007Z"}
