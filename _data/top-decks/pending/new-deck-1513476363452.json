Saffira is great too. I found her very useful when I see my opponent struggling with resources, I get her out and have them discard. at the point, they would scoop. I ran no birds cause I personally found it cloggy on the field and eats up your normal summon when you could've used it for your senju or cyber petit.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main2":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main3":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Benten","main7":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main10":"Bacon Saver","main11":"Cyber Petit Angel","main12":"Cyber Petit Angel","main13":"Hymn of Light","main14":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main15":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main16":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main17":"Machine Angel Ritual","main18":"Nobleman of Extermination","main19":"Sprite's Blessing","date":"2017-12-17T02:06:03.452Z"}
