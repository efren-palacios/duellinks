I had many opportunities to rank up with multiple deck types (Sylvans, CA, Aliens, and DWs) but I like to stay in legend for most of the month for more competitive play. I had two DW decks that I used one with archfiends and this one I used with trunade. The trunade build was more fun since it was easier to get an OTK. , I also switched between the necro fear and broww a few times but ultimately decided on the necro fear build","main0":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main1":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main2":"Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World","main3":"Dark Necrofear","main4":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main5":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main6":"Snoww, Unlight of Dark World","main7":"Trance Archfiend","main8":"Trance Archfiend","main9":"Trance Archfiend","main10":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main11":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main12":"Ceruli, Guru of Dark World","main13":"Dark World Dealings","main14":"Dark World Dealings","main15":"Dark World Dealings","main16":"Dark World Lightning","main17":"Dark World Lightning","main18":"Hey, Trunade!","main19":"Hey, Trunade!","date":"2018-03-27T02:55:13.051Z"}
