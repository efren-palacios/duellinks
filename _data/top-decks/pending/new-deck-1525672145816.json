Felt like this Deck was really consistent, with fate completely shutting down different decks at times. Of course with that, this deck can get crushed by Chaos Hunter. Other losses are because of misplays. All in all, very strong deck but requires a lot more thought in what you need to set up/do. \r\nDEATH TO SYLVANS","main0":"Prophecy Destroyer","main1":"Prophecy Destroyer","main2":"Prophecy Destroyer","main3":"Reaper of Prophecy","main4":"The Tricky","main5":"The Tricky","main6":"The Tricky","main7":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main8":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main9":"Spellbook Magician of Prophecy","main10":"Spellbook Library of the Crescent","main11":"Spellbook of Eternity","main12":"Spellbook of Eternity","main13":"Spellbook of Eternity","main14":"Spellbook of Fate","main15":"Spellbook of Fate","main16":"Spellbook of Fate","main17":"Spellbook of Life","main18":"Spellbook of Power","main19":"Spellbook of Power","main20":"Spellbook of Secrets","main21":"Spellbook of Secrets","main22":"Spellbook of Secrets","main23":"Spellbook of the Master","main24":"Spellbook of the Master","main25":"Spellbook of the Master","main26":"That Grass Looks Greener","main27":"That Grass Looks Greener","main28":"That Grass Looks Greener","main29":"Treacherous Trap Hole","date":"2018-05-07T05:49:05.815Z","layout":"post","message":" ","timestamp":1525672145,"tags":["comment-subscription"]}
