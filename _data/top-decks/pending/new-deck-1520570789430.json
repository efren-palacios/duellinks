REZ is still tier 1 but KoG with aliens was just so easy I just caved and played it in the end. REZ to Legend 3 and then Aliens to KoG.Aliens easiest deck to KoG with since tier 0 CA imo","main0":"Alien Overlord","main1":"Alien Warrior","main2":"Alien Warrior","main3":"Alien Telepath","main4":"Alien Telepath","main5":"Alien Telepath","main6":"Alien Grey","main7":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main8":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main9":"\"A\" Cell Recombination Device","main10":"Anti-Magic Arrows","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Brainwashing Beam","main15":"Brainwashing Beam","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-03-09T04:46:29.430Z"}
