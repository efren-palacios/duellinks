So many deck types it was hard getting a streak in L3. I was cursed with bad hands. God hands and then run into a hard counter and just tilted out of frustration. But I am not one to quite. Shy of 300 games but 5th KOG. Geargias have the best matchup in the current META imo. I had a solid streak with Grit Sylvans but in L3 it just brick 3 in a row after a 13 game win streak. I almost got it with Amazoness but got beat. Heroes almost got me there again but got tilted again. I saw a build here earlier with Treach Trap hole in a Gears build. I thought it was a meme. But when you try to Drilldark+Decider and I pop this, you have to chain mask. Then Pulse or econ would tilt that and I just won next turn or they scooped. Honestly Paleo, Treach and Pulse and a 1 off PR was phenomenal. SRH was good as amazoness like to attack in thinking econ but get tilted instead.
