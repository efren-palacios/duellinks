Tried climbing with other meta decks but they were all not consistent enough in legend. This deck has an answer to everything, and bricking was seldom the problem. Often times if I lost, it was because I misplayed . This struggles a lot against SSA decks that run lots of abyss soldiers, aroma hazys, and optimized glads. Had the misfortune of running into Whybona for my rank-up game. 100% lose against golden flying fish oyster meister deck. The techs: defender auto wins against beatdown hazy, emergency helps to get rid of dead cards in a pinch, bottomless is a situational des counterblow, and the dna transplant helps you win against unoptimized SSA decks.","main0":"Lava Golem","main1":"Lava Golem","main2":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main3":"Bacon Saver","main4":"Kuriboh","main5":"Sphere Kuriboh","main6":"Sphere Kuriboh","main7":"Golden Ladybug","main8":"Golden Ladybug","main9":"Golden Ladybug","main10":"Inaba White Rabbit","main11":"Backup Squad","main12":"Backup Squad","main13":"Emergency Provisions","main14":"Supremacy Berry","main15":"Supremacy Berry","main16":"Temple of the Mind's Eye","main17":"Temple of the Mind's Eye","main18":"Temple of the Mind's Eye","main19":"Bottomless Shifting Sand","main20":"Curse of Anubis","main21":"DNA Transplant","main22":"Draining Shield","main23":"Draining Shield","main24":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main25":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main26":"Massivemorph","main27":"Massivemorph","main28":"Massivemorph","main29":"Wall of Disruption","extra0":"Gladiator Beast Heraklinos","extra1":"Gladiator Beast Nerokius","extra2":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra3":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","extra4":"Gladiator Beast Essedarii","date":"2018-03-03T23:10:55.150Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
