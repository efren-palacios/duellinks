Tried a variety of decks and lost a promo, most decks werenâ€™t consistent at all...\r\nThe reason why SSA did well is because it destroys Amazoness, has a decent matchup vs Sylvans in general and also vs Masked heroes. \r\n\r\nI did play vs some Geargias, but Canadia and Abyss soldier deal with them. What can I say? Last month I KoGed with REZ, this month with SSA. Am 2 metas behind, just like Soup8?","main0":"Citadel Whale","main1":"Citadel Whale","main2":"Citadel Whale","main3":"Abyss Soldier","main4":"Abyss Soldier","main5":"Abyss Soldier","main6":"Gishki Chain","main7":"Gishki Chain","main8":"Gishki Chain","main9":"Gishki Beast","main10":"Fishborg Planter","main11":"Fishborg Planter","main12":"Fishborg Planter","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Paleozoic Canadia","main16":"Paleozoic Canadia","main17":"Paleozoic Canadia","main18":"Sea Stealth Attack","main19":"Sea Stealth Attack","date":"2018-05-05T06:57:42.583Z","pageless":true,"templateKey":"comments","tags":[],"timestamp":1525503462}
