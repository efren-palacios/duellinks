Stack your Trunade or whatever you need next and get a free spell/LVL 8 light Fairy for OTK next turn. Going 2nd you most likely win. Harder MA: Anything that summons more than 1 monster per turn (In some cases you get 2 Dakini summons per turn to OTK through 2 monsters). Really fast games (up to 20/hour)! Will use it for Stage 2 ;)","main0":"Shinato, King of a Higher Plane","main1":"Shinato, King of a Higher Plane","main2":"Shinato, King of a Higher Plane","main3":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main4":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main5":"Gishki Chain","main6":"Gishki Chain","main7":"Gishki Chain","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main10":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main11":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main12":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main13":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main14":"Sprite's Blessing","main15":"Sprite's Blessing","main16":"Sprite's Blessing","main17":"Hey, Trunade!","main18":"Hey, Trunade!","main19":"Hey, Trunade!","date":"2018-04-09T20:19:06.139Z"}
