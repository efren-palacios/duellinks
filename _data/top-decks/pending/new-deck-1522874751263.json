I'm a big fan of Little City from the TCG so I just decided to challenge myself for fun. I also ran a variant with Alius and Field of the Warriors because he can actually run over Komush, but Mask Change into Vapor is already a good out for that deck. This is strictly inferior to the Destiny HERO version, but Ocean is a really good card that has better recursion than the other deck.","main0":"Elemental HERO Heat","main1":"Elemental HERO Heat","main2":"Elemental HERO Heat","main3":"Elemental HERO Ocean","main4":"Elemental HERO Ocean","main5":"Elemental HERO Ocean","main6":"Elemental HERO Wildheart","main7":"Elemental HERO Wildheart","main8":"Elemental HERO Ice Edge","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Mask Change","main15":"Mask Change","main16":"Mask Change","main17":"Wall of Disruption","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","extra0":"Masked HERO Vapor","extra1":"Masked HERO Vapor","extra2":"Masked HERO Vapor","extra3":"Masked HERO Goka","extra4":"Masked HERO Goka","date":"2018-04-04T20:45:51.263Z","timestamp":1522874751,"layout":"post"}
