Climbing was really hard as the top decks have a weird rock/scissors/paper relationship. Whenever I came close to ranking up, Spellbooks or an unlucky draw in the mirror would ruin the day. \r\n\r\nAlso, I do not have Amazoness Queen yet and my Mai never seems to drop Swordswoman. Hopefully the deck remains viable next season though!","main0":"Sylvan Hermitree","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Guardioak","main3":"Sylvan Guardioak","main4":"Sylvan Guardioak","main5":"World Carrotweight Champion","main6":"World Carrotweight Champion","main7":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main8":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main9":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main10":"Rose Lover","main11":"Rose Lover","main12":"Rose Lover","main13":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main14":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main15":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Enemy Controller","main18":"Tribute to the Doomed","main19":"Treacherous Trap Hole","date":"2018-05-16T17:32:32.097Z","layout":"post","message":" "}
