Only changes made were mind scan over balance and -1 mirror wall for +1 floodgate, -1 Chalice for Cyclone which did come in handy . I honestly hated mirror wall in GB for a while but decided to give it a go and can say it did not disappoint, usually netted me card advantage as opposed to impenatrable attack. I like it.
