Switched to Geargias for some more relaxing duels and hit KOG with a total of 48wins. \r\nI only play 2 Ties bc I only have 2 but never really missed the third one. Mirror Wall was the MVP of the deck - no one plays around it anymore.","main0":"Geargiattacker","main1":"Geargiattacker","main2":"Geargianchor","main3":"Geargianchor","main4":"Geargianchor","main5":"Geargiarsenal","main6":"Geargiarsenal","main7":"Geargiarsenal","main8":"Enemy Controller","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Forbidden Chalice","main12":"Ties of the Brethren","main13":"Ties of the Brethren","main14":"Mirror Wall","main15":"Mirror Wall","main16":"Powerful Rebirth","main17":"Pulse Mines","main18":"Pulse Mines","main19":"Pulse Mines","date":"2018-05-02T18:49:57.114Z","tags":[]}
