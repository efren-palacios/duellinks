Also I only had two Senju and that is why I was running two only. I put two Gishki Chain for two reasons: first is I do not have other ritual support monster, second is a lot of Mask Hero Decks are running deciders. Every time my first main account was playing against Mask Hero, I had a hard time playing since I did not have any thing to get rid of two Deciders, so running two Gishki Chain helped a lot. Also I had 14 win streak before KOG if I was not wrong. Sometimes do not be afraid to be OTKed because Grit helps a lot when you are full LP.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main2":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main3":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Benten","main7":"Gishki Chain","main8":"Gishki Chain","main9":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main10":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main11":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main12":"Cyber Petit Angel","main13":"Hymn of Light","main14":"Hymn of Light","main15":"Hymn of Light","main16":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main17":"Machine Angel Ritual","main18":"Sprite's Blessing","main19":"Sprite's Blessing","date":"2018-04-24T05:11:06.474Z"}
