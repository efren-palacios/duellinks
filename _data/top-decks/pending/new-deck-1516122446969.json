Would have gotten Kog in 30 games if it werent for different bamboo variations every 4th-5th match and Dark world otk's. Really good matchup vs most control decks, but struggles vs burn and phoenix. Got kog after 50 games in total. Since their monster returns on your turn you can just switch dream clown into defense once they return and monster ratios in most control decks atm are lower than S/T. Which means if you get the clown/doom lord going they will eventually run out of monsters.","main0":"Sergeant Electro","main1":"Sergeant Electro","main2":"Sergeant Electro","main3":"Dream Clown","main4":"Dream Clown","main5":"Dream Clown","main6":"Destiny HERO - Doom Lord","main7":"Destiny HERO - Doom Lord","main8":"Destiny HERO - Doom Lord","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Super Rush Headlong","main11":"Super Rush Headlong","main12":"Super Rush Headlong","main13":"Curse of Anubis","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Powerful Rebirth","main18":"Powerful Rebirth","main19":"Windstorm of Etaqua","date":"2018-01-16T17:07:26.969Z","timestamp":1516122446}
