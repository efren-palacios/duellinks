Bouncing off set Komoshroomo, that turn one Dakini/Safira and set gears was crucial in putting the opponent at a disadvantage, not to mention getting Citadel Whale and Fishborg in the grave meant I had some decent grave setup. The second best card in terms of impact was Ultimate providence which if you managed to get out first turn meant Sylvans and Gears basically lost their first turn play, not to mention opposing Citadel whales. This deck is still by no means perfect and would probably get massacred if run in early season, but that's not to see that it's also one of the most fun decks I've had the pleasure of playing with in recent months.","main0":"Citadel Whale","main1":"Citadel Whale","main2":"Citadel Whale","main3":"Abyss Soldier","main4":"Abyss Soldier","main5":"Gishki Chain","main6":"Gishki Chain","main7":"Hammer Shark","main8":"Hammer Shark","main9":"Hammer Shark","main10":"Fishborg Planter","main11":"Fishborg Planter","main12":"Fishborg Planter","main13":"Beautunaful Princess","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Sea Stealth Attack","main17":"Sea Stealth Attack","main18":"Ultimate Providence","main19":"Ultimate Providence","date":"2018-04-29T05:24:47.791Z","pageless":true,"templateKey":"comments","tags":[]}
