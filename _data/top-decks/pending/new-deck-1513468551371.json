I was going second as a cyber angel deck and had the Turn 2 OTK, but I surrendered to give him KoG. Afterwards I looked at his deck and this is what he was running.  I think I only lost twice from Legend 1 to KoG using this deck.  The MVP was the anti-magic arrows.  Over half of my wins came after playing AMA since nobody is playing around it.","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main2":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main3":"Cyber Angel Benten","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main6":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main7":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main8":"Sonic Bird","main9":"Sonic Bird","main10":"Cyber Petit Angel","main11":"Cyber Petit Angel","main12":"Anti-Magic Arrows","main13":"Anti-Magic Arrows","main14":"Enemy Controller","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main17":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main18":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main19":"Machine Angel Ritual","date":"2017-12-16T23:55:51.370Z"}
