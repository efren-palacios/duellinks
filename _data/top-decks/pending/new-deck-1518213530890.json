This deck is evil and I encourage all of you to use it. This deck takes advantage of the new 3SD that requires no LP to summon Kazejin. Why Kazejin over the other 3 guardians? Simple Kazejin and big Shield gardna are both compatible with ready for intercepting meaning you can stop a bunch of problems such as gardna getting flipped into attack and also resetting Kazejin's effect. Chalice is mainly in here to stop dakini plays, but I found it very versatile. Ready for intercepting really messes up a bunch of things, it can stop econ take plays and stop a murmillo target.","main0":"Lava Golem","main1":"Lava Golem","main2":"Kazejin","main3":"Kazejin","main4":"Kazejin","main5":"Kuriboh","main6":"Big Shield Gardna","main7":"Big Shield Gardna","main8":"Big Shield Gardna","main9":"Burning Land","main10":"Burning Land","main11":"Forbidden Chalice","main12":"Forbidden Chalice","main13":"Curse of Anubis","main14":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Ready for Intercepting","main17":"Ready for Intercepting","main18":"Wall of Disruption","main19":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-02-09T21:58:50.890Z","layout":"post","message":" ","timestamp":1518213530,"tags":["user-generated"]}
