Past seasons I've tried to reach KOG with this one (my precious) but I couldn't. It's good against everything but Hazy Flame because of the Beast Rising. I still think this deck can be optimized, and I hope you guys help me optimizing it. Maybe when Bonz comes out it will shine. Thank you.","main0":"Heavy Knight of the Flame","main1":"Heavy Knight of the Flame","main2":"Gozuki","main3":"Gozuki","main4":"Gozuki","main5":"Samurai Skull","main6":"Goblin Zombie","main7":"Bacon Saver","main8":"Il Blud","main9":"Il Blud","main10":"Cosmic Cyclone","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Supervise","main15":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main16":"Floodgate Trap Hole","main17":"Impenetrable Attack","main18":"Mirror Wall","main19":"Mirror Wall","main20":"Xing Zhen Hu","date":"2017-12-17T05:01:51.441Z"}
