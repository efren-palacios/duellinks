It was a quick run as this deck is tier 1 of course. The only struggles this deck had was against the new decks but after a while I was able to adjust. The 3 storms I love because most decks are back row heavy and this allows you to force some plays and go all out for the win.","main0":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main1":"Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon","main2":"Red-Eyes Wyvern","main3":"Gozuki","main4":"Gozuki","main5":"Samurai Skull","main6":"Samurai Skull","main7":"Samurai Skull","main8":"Bacon Saver","main9":"Enemy Controller","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Red-Eyes Insight","main13":"Red-Eyes Insight","main14":"Red-Eyes Insight","main15":"Storm","main16":"Storm","main17":"Storm","main18":"Red-Eyes Spirit","main19":"Red-Eyes Spirit","main20":"Wall of Disruption","date":"2018-02-24T08:09:24.528Z"}
