Amazoness Paladin is still a slot I'm testing, for sure. I just feel like Sage is a dead card in every matchup not named geargia, and even then, you just lose to pulse in geargia anyway so there's no point. The list beats everything not named geargia, good matchup vs sylvans, masks, what have you. It struggles against some rogue/off meta decks like REZ or aliens","main0":"Amazoness Queen","main1":"Amazoness Paladin","main2":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main3":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main4":"Amazoness Swords Woman","main5":"Amazoness Princess","main6":"Amazoness Princess","main7":"Amazoness Princess","main8":"Amazoness Baby Tiger","main9":"Amazoness Baby Tiger","main10":"Enemy Controller","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Forbidden Chalice","main13":"Forbidden Chalice","main14":"Amazoness Onslaught","main15":"Amazoness Onslaught","main16":"Amazoness Onslaught","main17":"Amazoness Willpower","main18":"Powerful Rebirth","main19":"Powerful Rebirth","date":"2018-05-04T04:59:13.688Z","tags":[],"pageless":true,"templateKey":"comments","timestamp":1525409953,"layout":"post","message":" "}
