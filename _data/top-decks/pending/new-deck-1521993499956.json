Sylvans were my favorite deck back before I gave up on the tcg so I had to use them. Tested a ton of stuff from gold 1 all the way to KOG. Tested different numbers of backrow, 3 is my preferred number. Also tested cards like Econ, mad plants, merchant (which is terrible), trunade and other stuff, but the effect negation is just too vital to the deck. It took longer to get through plat than it did legend, with only 2 losses through my legend climb using this deck. 1 loss to aliens and the other to CA.","main0":"Sylvan Hermitree","main1":"Sylvan Hermitree","main2":"Sylvan Hermitree","main3":"Sylvan Guardioak","main4":"Sylvan Lotuswain","main5":"World Carrotweight Champion","main6":"World Carrotweight Champion","main7":"Sylvan Flowerknight","main8":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main9":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main10":"Sylvan Marshalleaf","main11":"Rose Lover","main12":"Rose Lover","main13":"Rose Lover","main14":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main15":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main16":"Sylvan Komushroomo","main17":"Divine Wrath","main18":"Ultimate Providence","main19":"Ultimate Providence","date":"2018-03-25T15:58:19.956Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
