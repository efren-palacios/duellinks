I wasn't sure of what to use, last time I did PvP was when REZD/Handless were tier 1, and CA's + Ninjas didn't exist. Checked Dkayed's YT channel, saw his most recent hazy deck, and climbed from rookkie 1 to KoG with it in 87 duels. 77 wins, 10 losses.","main0":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main1":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main2":"Hazy Flame Cerbereus","main3":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main4":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main5":"Hazy Flame Sphynx","main6":"Flame Tiger","main7":"Flame Tiger","main8":"Hazy Flame Peryton","main9":"Hazy Flame Peryton","main10":"Hazy Flame Peryton","main11":"Caninetaur","main12":"Sphere Kuriboh","main13":"Sphere Kuriboh","main14":"Sphere Kuriboh","main15":"Enemy Controller","main16":"Enemy Controller","main17":"Beast Rising","main18":"Beast Rising","main19":"Beast Rising","date":"2017-12-19T14:17:29.227Z"}
