Divine wrath came in handy vs SSA quite a bit dealing with Abyss Soldier and Citadel- otherwise they just smash into you. Extra TotB appreciate it as a discard outlet too. \r\n\r\ngood deck, looking forward to KC cup","main0":"Geargiattacker","main1":"Geargiattacker","main2":"Geargianchor","main3":"Geargianchor","main4":"Geargianchor","main5":"Geargiarsenal","main6":"Geargiarsenal","main7":"Geargiarsenal","main8":"Forbidden Chalice","main9":"Ties of the Brethren","main10":"Ties of the Brethren","main11":"Ties of the Brethren","main12":"Curse of Anubis","main13":"Divine Wrath","main14":"Divine Wrath","main15":"Paleozoic Canadia","main16":"Paleozoic Canadia","main17":"Pulse Mines","main18":"Pulse Mines","main19":"Pulse Mines","date":"2018-04-06T04:22:39.360Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
