You get to draw 2 cards and also you can dump D-Hero Celestial with it to use it next turn with the banish draw 2 effect. Enemy Controller, Forbidden Chalice, and Cosmic Cyclone great staples for the current meta. Treacherous Trap Hole works wonders with Masked Heroes it's a MUST for me, you use it and you toggle ON then chain Mask Change now your monster isn't targeted anymore with Treacherous. In certain scenarios this play concluded the match, it can get you out of jams aswell.","main0":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main1":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main2":"Destiny HERO - Celestial","main3":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main4":"Destiny HERO - Decider","main5":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main6":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main7":"Destiny HERO - Drilldark","main8":"Cosmic Cyclone","main9":"Cosmic Cyclone","main10":"Destiny Draw","main11":"Enemy Controller","main12":"Enemy Controller","main13":"Enemy Controller","main14":"Forbidden Chalice","main15":"Forbidden Chalice","main16":"Mask Change","main17":"Mask Change","main18":"Mask Change","main19":"Treacherous Trap Hole","extra0":"Masked HERO Anki","extra1":"Masked HERO Anki","extra2":"Masked HERO Anki","timestamp":1527203483,"date":"2018-05-24T23:11:23.708Z","tags":["comment-subscription"]}
