Took me from lvl 10-20 in kc cup stage 1 easily (didnt really play Stage 2) as well. Lylaâ€™s destroy facedown effect came in handy many times before setting up a big emperor play. Fiend Griefing is such a good tech especially in this meta - Most effectively used to send Rose Lover, CarrotWeight, Dhero Celestial, Fishborg, or any fuel for MAAR back to the deck - then put an Emperor in the GY. Used Archfiend Roar during opponents end phase to bring back calvary or empress- then when destroyed, bought Emperor back from GY. Restart skill to have a mill card + archfiend roar/Call in the first hand.","main0":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main1":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main2":"Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror","main3":"Archfiend Empress","main4":"Archfiend Empress","main5":"Archfiend Cavalry","main6":"Archfiend Cavalry","main7":"Archfiend Cavalry","main8":"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress","main9":"Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress","main10":"Archfiend's Roar","main11":"Archfiend's Roar","main12":"Archfiend's Roar","main13":"Fiend Griefing","main14":"Fiend Griefing","main15":"Needlebug Nest","main16":"Needlebug Nest","main17":"Call of the Archfiend","main18":"Call of the Archfiend","main19":"Call of the Archfiend","date":"2018-04-17T08:50:14.518Z","layout":"post","message":" ","timestamp":1523955014}
