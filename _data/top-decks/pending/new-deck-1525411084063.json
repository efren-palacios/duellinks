Made all my climb with 30 cards spellbooks since plat 4, tried some variations like needlebug nest, Lyla, non fool, 3 econs. This was the one I most felt confortable with. Deck is so much fun to play and has the biggest learning curve(which was kind a challenge to me cuz I've never played tcg ever) in the game. Anyway deck is fun, is good but I still pretty disapointed with it's power, imo needs more control support besides fate and/or better bosses, was hyped af to play it, saw a lot of ppl saying it would be busted, well, imo it's so so far way to be busted, definitly not worth the investment and time.
