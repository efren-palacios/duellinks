Even spent some time with a Cyber Angels build that had 2 Dakini, but it really is best to have that extra protection. Balance also seems super important. I really liked the ratio of 2 of each ritual spell and the 1 MAR. Saffira draw 2 discard 1 is broken AF. Discarding opponent's cards was rarely the best choice, but there were some fun moments where I hit Golden Ladybugs. That's about all I have to say for now! Good luck on your climbs everyone!","main0":"Cyber Angel Dakini","main1":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main2":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main3":"Saffira, Queen of Dragons","main4":"Cyber Angel Benten","main5":"Cyber Angel Benten","main6":"Cyber Angel Benten","main7":"Cyber Angel Idaten","main8":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main9":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main10":"Senju of the Thousand Hands","main11":"Cyber Petit Angel","main12":"Cyber Petit Angel","main13":"Hymn of Light","main14":"Hymn of Light","main15":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main16":"Machine Angel Absolute Ritual","main17":"Machine Angel Ritual","main18":"Sprite's Blessing","main19":"Sprite's Blessing","date":"2018-02-10T02:57:56.401Z","layout":"post","message":" ","timestamp":1518231476,"tags":["user-generated"]}
