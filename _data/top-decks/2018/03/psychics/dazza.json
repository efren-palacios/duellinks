You can set up for otks pretty quickly or at least leave your opponent in a tough spot next turn with destructotron, psychokinesis, econ etc. If i had them, i'd replace the shocker with another borg and maybe find space for powerful rebirth."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/psychics/fate-psychics-by-dazza/"}
