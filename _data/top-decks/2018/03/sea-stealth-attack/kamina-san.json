SSA whale is so underwhelming. It takes a lot of resources to get it out. IF you get it out, and then it is wrecked by 1 CC, or is often OTKd by someone forcing you to to banish with SRH.  I used both BuiltToTilt's deck and this one. BTT honestly felt more reliable, and is probable the best build, but after losing my KoG Promo 6 times, I was done with it, and switched to this. \r\n\r\nI lost mostly to Destiny Heroes, and it was almost auto lose to CA. \r\n I also lost to chazz burn and DD Burn 7 times  at my kog promo,  before hitting KoG, by beating a Janky ass CA deck that ran three Twisters and Vennu. \r\n\r\nThe best card in the deck is abyss soldier. Took me 125 games from plat 1 to KoG. Honestly this shit sucks, and if I had stuck with fishies, I would have been KoG in half the time."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/sea-stealth-attack/-by-kamina-san/"}
