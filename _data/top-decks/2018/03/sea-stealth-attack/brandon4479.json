Being able to put cards back into your opponents hand just keeps setting them back. Especially if they need those cards in the grave to work which was quite often the case. Also the combos when discarding Fishborg Planter or Whale using abyss was used a lot to great effect! Big thanks to Built to Tilt for the list"}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/sea-stealth-attack/water-deck-by-brandon4479/"}
