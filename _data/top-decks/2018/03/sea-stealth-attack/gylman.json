Didn't feel like Abyss Soldier did much - only helped when I didn't have ALO+SSA ready to go. I've never ranked up this fast before - 61 wins from Plat 1 to KOG.   Only REZ gave me trouble because of their swarming power before I can get going.  No trouble with burns, little trouble with aliens.  Great deck against Sylvans and I usually beat the Citadel Whale decks because my SSA was up and running before theirs was.   Didn't see any CA or Destiny Hero decks on the climb - I think they would have been trouble.  Only issue is consistency, and I guess I was lucky."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/sea-stealth-attack/ssa-5-by-gylman/"}
