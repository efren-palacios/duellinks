The mirror or better said against the other ssa it has the speed bonus plus abyss soldier plus. The Mako Fish trap has so much value and allows you to deal with all threats esspecially the early ones.. it struggles a bit against Caffira but if you live their offensive play you have good chance To win.. Econ still the best card in the game.. hopefully they limit this... literally every deck can not afford to play NO ECON ... so always choose you Deck and put the Econs in it nd u good to go\r\nPowerful rebirth also a good tech.. let you go for lethal and prevent you from a open field when summoning whale"}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/sea-stealth-attack/mako-water-by-janko777/"}
