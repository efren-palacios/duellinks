Just sitting on a whale (without ALO) or Abyss was enough to buy me time to set up or play the beatdown. Cloudian engine over hammer shark or gishki because it didn’t require my hand to have a specific monster and brings out fodder for whale turn 1. Econ/Anubis was mostly for def if they baited my banish. Anubis over 2nd econ for Whale mirror, Hazy, and to prevent otks. CC for cancer decks. Found the ratios great."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/sea-stealth-attack/whamon-by-asta/"}
