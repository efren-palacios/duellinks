I could've made it to KoG with 25 wins instead of 41 but lost 3 KoG promotions. 2 were against stall burn and 1 backrow-hate dinosaurs.\r\n\r\nThe best part about the deck was when I stole saffira by brainwash and used its effect (did it many times during my climb). Also, i'd like to thank WoD for making people surrender."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/aliens/aliens-by-limitless95/"}
