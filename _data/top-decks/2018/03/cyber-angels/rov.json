For opponents with heavy backrow, it's all about starting defensively by prioritizing  Saffira (with protection and ideally partnered with a Senju on the field) to get your hands on Fenghuang asap. The main keys of this deck are its consistency and its ability to cycle through cards extremely fast, both from the deck and graveyard."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/cyber-angels/saffirad-by-rov/"}
