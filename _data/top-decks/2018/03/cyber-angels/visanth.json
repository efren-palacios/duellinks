Hey, Trunade is kinda dumb going 2nd combined with CA's abillity to find an Otk from even a mediocre opening hand.\r\n\r\nWas using restart at first but found that it led to more unplayable hands with Trunade getting in the way. Standby played great as a way to find Trunade often enough while also having enough cards in hand to get the engine going. Never tried balance but it looked like brick city from getting Trunade and no ritual spells. Could work with +1 petite or Sonic Birb -1 Senju I guess.\r\n\r\n Also was on +1 MAAR -1Saffira originally but noticed my brick rate was high from drawing too many spells and not enough dudes. Decided on 3rd Saffira since I couldn't just play a 4th Benten. 2nd petite would be a little bricky since I was already expiriencing some occasional minor inconvenience from drawing too many searchers I couldn't play in one turn.\r\n\r\nMajority of my loses were from going 1st and getting otk'd. Many different scenarios too. A lot of econ take though. Wish the deck had room for a counter to econ on the play. Hey, trunade might still be more valuable in that slot though"}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/cyber-angels/kog-mar-18-by-visanth/"}
