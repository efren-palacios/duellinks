It helps a lot in the Alien matchup and gives you another way to play around Econ-takes in general. Though, Aliens will probably still win if they have an Econ-take play ready for when your boss monster comes back, but ladder players seem to prefer running 3 Triangles over Econs for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the math for Balance works with 21 cards, but I still always opened with 2 monsters and 1 spell. I opened with Dimension Gate only about 1/5 games, but I often drew into one within the first few turns.\r\n\r\nFaced mostly Aliens, Water, REZ, and D-Heroes on the climb. Aliens are still the worst matchup, and I got lucky I didn't run into any in my 5 win streak to KOG. D-Heroes are also a huge problem if you don't OTK them before they get their Deciders out. Besides those, the new Tea Mill with Warm Worm + Chain Destruction is also an auto-loss, but I only ran into 3 of those out of 40 ish games."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/cyber-angels/sephora-angels-by-rezileen/"}
