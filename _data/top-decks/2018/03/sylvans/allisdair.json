I didn't lose from legend 1 to kog with this. Wrath/Providence are autowins vs the mirror and vs CA when they summon Dakini via Absolute ritual. Also think Forbidden Chalice could be good too though, possibly even better because it's much more versatile, doesn't miss timing on Dakini ever, and hits Mushroom in the dmg step."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/sylvans/-by-allisdair/"}
