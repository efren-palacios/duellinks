The deck is extremely disruptive ATM since the meta hasn’t adjusted to deal with Sylvans yet. I used the same deck as wowerer’s pinned deck with +1 Providence -1  Devine since I didn’t have a 2nd Devine. Not much difference between Providence and Devine since your only real fodder are monster cards anyways. Econ take carrot resummon, and Econ take rose special summon are clutch."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/sylvans/sylvan-by-tonyvpb/"}
