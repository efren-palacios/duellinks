The deck is beyond busted. I went 15 - 2 only losses were LP0 turn one cyber/king lockout and a very lucky top deck Econ take from a Aromage deck. I played around with a lot of stuff at the beginning of the season to feel out the meta so it took me awhile to get here. The only changes I would make is dropping a Hermitree for another Divine Wrath. Even the one wrath came into play a few times. Oh yeah, Carrot-Econ take-Special summon Carrot is broke."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/sylvans/sylvans-by-cain/"}
