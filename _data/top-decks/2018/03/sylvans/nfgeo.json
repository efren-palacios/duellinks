Standard Sylvans build. Had to learn the deck as I was climbing the ladder. Won all of my Mirror matches because of divine wrath. The only tough match up was against SSA. It was fun watching burn decks scoop to this. This was my first KOG. Hoping to consistently hit KOG from here on out."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/sylvans/majestic-sylvans-by-nfgeo/"}
