I tried aliens, destiny hero, angels, flying fish but nothing was consistent. Took 100 duels with those to hit legends 1 and 30 to hit kog. This deck is not easy to play as people make it seem. You have to predict a lot of backrow and know when to use des and what to use morph on.(edited)\r\nA lot of the time it’s better not summon golem as the token wins games by itself. Hardest matchup is archfiends as I don’t think that’s a winnable matchup. Aliens is an auto win. SSA imo is also an auto win unless they have an early abyssal warrior. Without warrior dblow+temple wins. Flying fish you have to play around and fill their field before they can start comboing you to death. Toggle off wins games as kuriboh into golem wins the games. Not the hardest deck to play but requires a lot of matchup knowledge."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/burn-decks/let-the-world-suffer-by-hidden-darkness/"}
