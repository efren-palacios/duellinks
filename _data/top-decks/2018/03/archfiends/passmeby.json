From the Kc cup to the new box releasing viable decks or empowering other deck types. I climbed from legend 1-3 with destiny board but with a different build. Some decks I didn't live long enough for the 5 turns so I switched to fiend farewell. Really good matchups across the board. Hardest matchup were hazy and sea stealth if they get the combo going."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/archfiends/f-i-n-a-l-by-passmeby/"}
