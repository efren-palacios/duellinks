Throughout my seasons once starting with the REZ deck, brick draws were a nuisance and I really didn't see too many plays where I either had both monsters on the field or I needed a second REZD in my hand. Minus burn for the tribute and few situational plays, I didn't miss it much.\r\n\r\nThe Snipe and Storm can in handy for burn and several situations where I destroyed backrow with this meta. A 3/2 ratio with Gozuki and Skull works best for me. I originally had Wall of Ds for the Rushes, but I kept running into locking cards and pulling them when I didn't help to set."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/red-eyes-zombies/uno-by-unpreceden7ed/"}
