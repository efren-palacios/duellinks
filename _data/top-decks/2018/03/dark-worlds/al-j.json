The reason for cutting down 4-starred ladybug on this version was that most of my matches were not 80% against Aliens and fish decks anymore.This time, the deck worked but it became bricky shortly after. \r\n\r\nLastly, I had to cut down my 2nd broww, then I  got myself to KOG smoothly with this build   I got rejected many times on KOG promo matches, but I had to keep believing in the name of Grapha."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/dark-worlds/-by-al-j/"}
