I had many opportunities to rank up with multiple deck types (Sylvans, CA, Aliens, and DWs) but I like to stay in legend for most of the month for more competitive play. I had two DW decks that I used one with archfiends and this one I used with trunade. The trunade build was more fun since it was easier to get an OTK. , I also switched between the necro fear and broww a few times but ultimately decided on the necro fear build"}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/dark-worlds/evosal-the-d-by-evosal/"}
