In my experience I would have my combo first turn a lot of the time.  Sylvans were easy since most of the time they just set 1 monster and end, at that point it's a free win. At one point I had 4 OTK's in a row vs sylvans before getting cucked on kog rank up. If you brick it's basically over."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/dark-worlds/dark-world-by-eternal/"}
