Tried climbing with other meta decks but they were all not consistent enough in legend. This deck has an answer to everything, and bricking was seldom the problem. Often times if I lost, it was because I misplayed . This struggles a lot against SSA decks that run lots of abyss soldiers, aroma hazys, and optimized glads. Had the misfortune of running into Whybona for my rank-up game. 100% lose against golden flying fish oyster meister deck. The techs: defender auto wins against beatdown hazy, emergency helps to get rid of dead cards in a pinch, bottomless is a situational des counterblow, and the dna transplant helps you win against unoptimized SSA decks."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/stall-decks/stall-by-machospleen/"}
