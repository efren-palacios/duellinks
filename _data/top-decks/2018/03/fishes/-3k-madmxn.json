The flying fish + oyster combo is a very strong 1 for 2 play, couple that with powerful rebirth and you can pop 4 of your opponents cards with that combo. Core of the deck is 3x flying fish, 3x oyster and 3x rebirth with tuna and depth charge being great support cards. I opted for 3x super rush instead of econ because I was facing a lot of whale decks. Main weakness of this deck is consistency, there was more than a few games where I opened all monsters but that is to be expected with the 10 monster lineup in the deck.\r\n\r\nPs: hammer shark isn't really essential to the deck and could be replaced with other fish type monsters in the future but it's the best we have for right now."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/fishes/fish-control-by-3k-madmxn/"}
