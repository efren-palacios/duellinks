Copied spoony_b4rd 's deck with the little change of an additional SRH for an econ. And the trap holes came out really handy. On the way to KOG played an alien deck where I was losing but he got cocky and instead of just finishing me off with his alien warrior, decided to summon a 36k-atk Ananta which I trap holed and eventually decked him out. Went 26-6 with this deck and  luckily didn't encounter a single SSA."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/fishes/son-of-a-fish-by-flint-sky/"}
