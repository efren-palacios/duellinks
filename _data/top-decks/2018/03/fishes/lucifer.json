Mythic Depths as the skill wasn't consistent enough for me. I saw people saying how the deck dominates if it opens well enough, so I figured Balance would work well given the card type ratios, and boy was I right. Winrate skyrocketed when I switched to Balance and I highly recommend it to anyone having trouble with this deck. Something interesting was how often I would use E-Con defensively and then follow up with sniping things with Golden Flying Fish. It was a very effective play. 2 Mirror Wall was decently effective. There were games where it came in clutch when WoD wouldn't have and there were games where the 1 WoD was vastly superior to Mirror Wall. The extra deck never came into play, aside from maybe making people think I was playing Gladiators. On that note, however, I never hid what I was playing when I went first. I absolutely always summoned something in face-up attack and set protection behind it."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/hammer-shark/gold-by-lucifer/"}
