I don't think it would be a great tourney deck but it's great for the ladder. XZH is the what ever you think works best utility card, it was my hero opening vs Aliens. Biggest problem I had was with Hazy, but that was only if I didnt get WOD early. Pretty fun deck and like most new box decks a lot of the ladder has no idea what to do against it yet."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/hammer-shark/fishsticks-by-hangmansol/"}
