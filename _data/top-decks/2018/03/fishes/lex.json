Its true that the 200 Atk boost didnt help be beat over anything in particular, though it does allow the Oyster token to be used offensively; which i needed to otk a fair few times. \r\n\r\nMind scan i suppose allows you to hit troublesome cards hidden amongst full backrow but never did i kick myself over it, instead wiping the whole field with tokens and rebirths. i need to test the mindscan variant myself before making an informed decision, feels unneeded; but i did go up against many decks also using the yami skill.. making that a bit redundant too\r\n\r\nGood Deck! at any rate, only 32 wins from Plat 4"}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/fishes/goldshark-depth-charge-by-lex/"}
