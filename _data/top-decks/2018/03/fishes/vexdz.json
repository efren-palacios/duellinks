Got to Legend with Sylvans then tilted due to running into OTK CA a few games in a row.  Switched to flying fish and had more success.   Special thanks to CwC | Kagami for the amazing encouragement and tips that pushed me to grind it out the last couple of days and to skillShot for giving me advice on the game after his recent tournament win - and of course the Discord and all it's members. Thanks!"}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/fishes/ultrainstinctflyingfish-by-vexdz/"}
