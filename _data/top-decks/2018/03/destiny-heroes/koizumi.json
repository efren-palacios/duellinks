It's very easy to misplay with this deck you have to think some turns forward, so dont worry if you fail at the beginnig. Trinity is real MVP he stole a lot of games especially against CA and hazy. The deck is very good and fun to play let's make it tier deck"}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/destiny-heroes/d-hero-by-koizumi/"}
