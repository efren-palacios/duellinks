Destiny heroes have never been about a themed deck only with them, but rather support cards with other strong cards. Got kog in 40 ish games and didnt lose a single game until legend 2. This is a slightly weaker wallet control in my opinion. @Dkayed Here's a ugabunga deck for your youtube. You can also easily get 3-5 cards for snipe hunter ammo."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/destiny-heroes/d-hero-beatdown-by-crazedd/"}
