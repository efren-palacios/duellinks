The deck went up against most meta decks and won. Legitimately has strong match ups across the board. Really enjoyed this deck and fusion/BoHaE variants but this seems to be the optimal build. I played 3 mirror matches which are quite difficult but D-signal came in clutch. I did intend to KoG with GB but had too much fun testing D-heroes sorry to my #gladiator-beasts  brethren"}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/destiny-heroes/-by-brenduke/"}
