Being able to dig into your deck every turn for your combos and fusions is so good. Every card in the deck felt like it belonged and was never dead. Vision hero vyon is by far the best card in this deck. If I have him in hand feels like I never brick. Also I'd play a 3rd hex seal if I had him, red eyes slash dragon is pretty good in this deck"}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/destiny-heroes/destiny-hefinny-by-shaowz/"}
