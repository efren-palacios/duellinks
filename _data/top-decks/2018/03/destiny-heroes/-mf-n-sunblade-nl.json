Then i saw a baggio named @Brenduke - GB Expert also hit KoG with it which gave me the motivation to do the same. Quite easy but my opponents weren't that good unfortunately. Although this deck can win versus any match up."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/destiny-heroes/destiny-hero-by-mf-n-sunblade-nl/"}
