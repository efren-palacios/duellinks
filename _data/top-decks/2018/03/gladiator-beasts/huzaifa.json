My losses were either misplays on me due to fatigue or komoney giving me  bricks or my enemy god hands. I won every matchup even in the hardest circumstances. I had 3 matches in a row vs magnets where they got turn 1 valk and stuff through grass and I won. I beat ca , aliens , magnets, phoenix , archfiends ,water  , dinos , and other shit on the ladder very hard. Surprised how badly people play around wod right now while during the kc cup I felt like people played around it much better. Nonetheless wod/impen is a meta call and dependent on if you face good or bad players. 2 dimi with srh is a superior set up than 2 murmillo as he is not worth running cause bricks. Also the 6-6 balance of backrow gives you far less bricks. Cosmic has won me multiple games solo and so has wind/curse/econ . Srh is the most consistent off them though as it will always give you some value pretty much. Floodgate will either win you or lose games so I ran 2 not 3 as it is way too polar. Anyhow I played a more aggro glad beast style and didn't sit around and wait. Pm me any questions and I'll be glad to help cause it's 1 am rn and very ecstatic lol."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/gladiator-beasts/glad-beast-ft-balance-by-huzaifa/"}
