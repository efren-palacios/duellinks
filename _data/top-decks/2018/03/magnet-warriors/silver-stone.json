It has good match ups against all decks except Dinos. However, it still can win with an aggressive AMA play. Cosmic Cyclone is a great out to SSA decks and Brainwashing beam. If you have the 3rd powerfull rebirth play it instead of kurogane."}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/magnet-warriors/magnet-is-a-worse-rez-by-silver-stone/"}
