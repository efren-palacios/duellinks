It is literally the only deck I have put together so far as I am broke. Expensive deck for being broke right? I got lucky. This deck probably cost about $50-60 (a lot for the Blazemen).     Little variations worth mentioning:     1x Elemental Hero Neos (for Blazeman effect)      1x Cosmic Cyclone (for SSA and general back row)"}],"url":"/top-decks/march-2018/red-eyes-slash-dragon/red-eyes-slash-by-crocohunter/"}
