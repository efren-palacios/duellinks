CA is as good as ever on the latter. I almost always Dakini effect because Econ is usually an auto-loss anyway. I only donâ€™t Dakini effect if Econ will not kill me or I want to attack into a weak monster for game. Be careful with early Idaten as well. They can swing into your senju/petit and then take your boosted ritual monster and win if you boost at a bad time. I always draw 2 discard unless I am facing mill, really need a graveyard Dakini, can already ritual next turn, or have great board control (meaning I would discard from opponents hand).
