My goal first was to KoG with a Power of Darkness of Peak performance deck for the memes. But that was kinda hard to do to be honest. A lot of decks have heavy backrow or floodgates and it makes it kinda hard to have those 5 wins in a row. After some time I used REZ STTG, but CA was kinda a problem vs REZ. Was pretty hard to deal with 2 high Attack targets. After that I switched to CA, but Suddenly I played Burn after Burn after Burn. So then a teammate, Jaydizzle, told me to just run Fairyâ€™s Smile instead of Balance. So I did that, and magically no Burn decks appeared in my 5 matches to KoG. Even though this is the deck I hit KoG with, I used a high variety of decks."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/cyber-angels/daenerys-targaryen-by-milliardo/"}
