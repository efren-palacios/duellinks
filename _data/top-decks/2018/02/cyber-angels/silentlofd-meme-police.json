As for CAffira deck, lost 2x promo with mind scan, couldnt reach promo with restart, lost 1x promo with standard build balance. And finally switched 1 petite with bacon and it did the job. If you're going first with saffira and bacon in hand, choose draw 2 and discard the bacon instead of the usual discard from opponents hand. It saved me from some e-con take attempts."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/cyber-angels/cyber-angels-by-silentlofd-meme-police/"}
