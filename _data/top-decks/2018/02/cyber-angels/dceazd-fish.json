Nothing to say about this deck actually, the top 2 players of MCS 5 were playing Saffira, so yeah. I just dislike playing 3 Saffiras, 2 is just fine for me:)\r\nAnti Magic Arrows was the real mvp, pushing me through some decks with no chances to interrupt. Sometimes bricky, but most of the time helped me rush my wajio to the Kog. I didn’t expect a lot of mirror matches, so only 1 E-Con. If you want more consistency - take one AMA out for a Petit Angel, but it wouldn’t matter too much."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/cyber-angels/restart-saffira-by-dceazd-fish/"}
