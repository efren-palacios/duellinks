Even spent some time with a Cyber Angels build that had 2 Dakini, but it really is best to have that extra protection. Balance also seems super important. I really liked the ratio of 2 of each ritual spell and the 1 MAR. Saffira draw 2 discard 1 is broken AF. Discarding opponent's cards was rarely the best choice, but there were some fun moments where I hit Golden Ladybugs. That's about all I have to say for now! Good luck on your climbs everyone!"}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/cyber-angels/cyber-angels-by-lucifer/"}
