Its focused on synergizing with Ties of Brethren to swarm, and abusing abyss soldiers busted ass effect, which happens to easily win games. Fisherman, ALO, and Whale are just extras for when things get sticky. SSA is amazing with Abyss since you can protect forever. Chain helps setup Abyss plays or can grab a fisherman if you have ALO up."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/sea-stealth-attack/tier-1-abyss-control-by-woconwater/"}
