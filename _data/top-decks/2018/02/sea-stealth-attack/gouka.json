If I had more Atlantis, I would probably rep the Abyss card. More fishermans is nice, but I would probably rep the ships with one if I did get a third. I think two is healthy though. This deck is more powerful than it should be because opponents sleep on the second effect of SSA and don't understand the remove-from-play abuse."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/sea-stealth-attack/sea-water-by-gouka/"}
