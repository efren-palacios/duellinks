I have a spicy replay of him missing all 3 rolls against an unprotected saffira on one promo. This replay will remind me not to use snipe hunter on my promo matches ever again. This deck is really good in the current meta.\r\n\r\nThe 3SD control deck has favourable match ups vs CA, GB, Dinosaurs, temple builds, ETH and burn. It has 50/50 matches vs hazy and REZD if they run e-con. (Sample is 80 games this season and over 50 in KoG rank in january)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend anyone ladders with snipe hunter as it can be very stressful and tilt inducing. However, I think this deck will do well in tournements where you can side into burn using lava golems."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/control-decks/brenduke-3sd-by-brenduke/"}
