Deck does pretty well against gb/dino/ca which I faced the most.  Current dino decks canâ€™t get over 2800 attack without backrow and ca just insta scoop vs paladin.  The deck gets destroyed by burn though but I was lucky enough to not run into many during the climb."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/red-eyes-slash-dragon/slash-by-chu/"}
