Dragon destroyer or paladin shuts down Safirah CA. Hazy is too slow. Other slash decks got bodied  because of dragon destroyer.  Ultimate providence is a saving grace against a magnet player. Would add a 3rd slash and take out 2nd paladin.  Burn is near impossible if they get temple out before you get paladin."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/red-eyes-slash-dragon/slash-by-donmega/"}
