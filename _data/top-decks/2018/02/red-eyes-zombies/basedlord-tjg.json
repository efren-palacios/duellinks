Had a very easy time versus Ca matchup thanks to WoD and Econ. Storm beat AG, Dinos, and Glad Beasts most every time. Skill successor was also very clutch, definitely didn’t steal the idea for it. Imo didn’t need bacon saver because I drew it so often but it was still very helpful overall"}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/red-eyes-zombies/anti-cheese-rezus-by-basedlord-tjg/"}
