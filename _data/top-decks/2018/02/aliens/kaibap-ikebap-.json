It requires crads from only 1 BOX and only 2 SR from the box. What does it mean ???? You only have to do ONE run to afford it ! And it's from the BEST box so far !\r\nAnyways, about the deck itself, It's a really agressive \"toolbox\" deck. You can do anything : Destroy monsters, steal, destroy backrow, OTK, etc. Your MAIN card is \"A\" recombination device : I use balance + 6 spells to open with it as often as possible. It searches, protects, get the engine going, etc. Usually you wanna use it to search telepath or overlord and destroy backrow or go for OTK plays, which are legion All the ST have nice little interaction between each other, just be creative with'em and you'll have a fun time my boi. Crop circles can look like a powerful rebirth but it's actually different, it's very agressive and pairs well with mysterious triangle and brainwashing, to recycle monsters. You can dodge kuriboh, go for BDN-like OTKs, anything you can imagine \r\nSooo yeah, I'm very excited that we have such a cool, original deck, without half the deck being generic backrow.. Have fun guys !"}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/aliens/ultra-instinct-jiren-by-kaibap-ikebap/"}
