My conclusion to all this testing is that Aliens are a great option for new players and veterans to pick up and play. The deck has a lot of favourable matchups, and only really loses to Hazy (who plays that anymore, right?) and burn (which i tend to just surrender turn 2-3 to save time). Lots of options with this list. Went with the 2 e-cons to allow for tribute take plays -> powerful rebirth my tributed monster; won so many games with that combo. Anubis over wall of D/Windstorm as it keeps enemy monsters stuck in defence if it gets CC'd. Also a good chainable stall card in general."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/aliens/aliens-by-frozenkingk0/"}
