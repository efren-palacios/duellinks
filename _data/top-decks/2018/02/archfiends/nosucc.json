Did not have the 3rd emperor or even a 3rd necrofear so i opted to run a lava golem because it has very niche applications that are pretty hilarious as well as it synergizes with the deck very well. Won all 5 games I played with it beating out mill, dark magician, new water, red eyes, amd finally aliens for kog"}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/archfiends/archfiend-by-nosucc/"}
