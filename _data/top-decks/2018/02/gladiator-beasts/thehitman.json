Brief diatribe on why IMO Restart is better than the uber consistency of Balance Glads.\r\n1. Kuriboh is too good rn and saved my ass countless times against TeAids Bamboo decks, REZ, Electro control etc. Def would like to test more like @Nurgull89 's build.\r\n2. Never have to open with Murmilo, I'd almost always restart Murm opens unless I had the god  backrow\r\n3. The ability to pseudo counter pick your opponent. In a meta so diverse, restart gives you a 2nd chance to draw back row more tailored to your opp. Not too hard to guess deck from characters/skills. Yeah once in a while you'll restart into 5 S/Ts dlmRage, but more often than not it's worth the gamble. Nothing better than dumping double econs vs Hazy.\r\nOh and restarting into floodgate if you're 1st is busted"}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/gladiator-beasts/gladiator-beasts-by-thehitman/"}
