I felt that enemy controller was too important this season because of the renaissance of cyber angels in the ladder. With the angels, D.draw burn came back; even though it was never a problem for gladiators it still led to long, annoying games. I barely faced ancient gears and their electros, so wall of d and impenetrable attack gained a lot of value. The most original deck I faced was during my win streak for kog where I met this Japanese player running  snipe hunter with ananta. During turn 2 he destroyed my monster with snipe hunter dumping a reptile and used the said reptile to  summon ananta. He had lynx to replenish his hand and fuel the sniper."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/gladiator-beasts/gb-balance-by-ap-tenma/"}
