So I thought take it out and go on the backrow hunt.\r\n1). People aren't expecting backrow like Xing and Gyokkou with glads so they play around you drawing a Bestiari like a normal Glad deck.\r\n2). I have 3 Laquari but the deck plays on fast  aggression with Econ and Dimacari, I found it worked best With 2 and 2 Electro. \r\n3). Also Laquari gets a boost from Gyokkou so runs well into the mirror match - the downside is you rarely get out Batman and Heraklinos..\r\nJust wanted to try something different this season and this was super fun to play.."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/gladiator-beasts/fast-glads-no-bestiari-by-tobeshodges/"}
