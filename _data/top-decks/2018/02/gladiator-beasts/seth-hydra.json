Ancient Gears are horrible rn and REZ kept bricking so figured, might as well run bootleg Glads and see if it works. I scrolled through this thread seeing other glad players and saw another player play them alongside weevil parasites. I thought that was pretty cool and I've got to admit, it worked very well (granted its late season). 4-star Ladybug was the MVP against snipe hunter volcanics, ancient gears and whoever  thought it's a good ideal to run srgt electro. The parasites were clutch in whittling down the HP and while i've never been a huge fan of Cosmic Cyclone, I am now."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/gladiator-beasts/weevil-gladiators-by-seth-hydra/"}
