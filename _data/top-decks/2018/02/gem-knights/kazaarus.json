If you open optimally then you will always have a fusion play and will always be able to maintain at least 3 cards in hand\r\nIf you don’t open poly then the majority of the time you can just play Volcanics, which is why this deck had so much success.\r\nBeatdown was 100% necessary in this meta; if it wasn’t then I would easily play either restart or duel standby and I guarantee this would open well almost 100% of the time. With those 2 skills you could probably run defensive cards as well\r\nBrick hands are: opening all gem-knights or opening both BA and poly\r\nOr somehow opening 1 garnet 1 tourmaline and 1 painful"}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/gem-knights/volcanic-knights-by-kazaarus/"}
