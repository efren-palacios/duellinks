Def the best build I tried and is very consistent. Got me from plat 1 to kog within 40ish games. With all the Dino with back row decks and all the GBs this can wipe out the entire back row or wipe out swarm heavy decks like hazy. Hardest match up to face is REZ mainly because bacon saver can mess up the OTK or the surprise splashed in kuriboh."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/dark-world/the-d-by-evosal/"}
