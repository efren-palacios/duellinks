This deck is evil and I encourage all of you to use it. This deck takes advantage of the new 3SD that requires no LP to summon Kazejin. Why Kazejin over the other 3 guardians? Simple Kazejin and big Shield gardna are both compatible with ready for intercepting meaning you can stop a bunch of problems such as gardna getting flipped into attack and also resetting Kazejin's effect. Chalice is mainly in here to stop dakini plays, but I found it very versatile. Ready for intercepting really messes up a bunch of things, it can stop econ take plays and stop a murmillo target."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/burn-decks/3sd-burn-nix-by-nix/"}
