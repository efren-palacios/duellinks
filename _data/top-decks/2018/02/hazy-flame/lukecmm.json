Another play would be tributing hazy and then killing a card and if there is a peryton in your grave you can special summon that and use its effect, deck worked really well really consistent and got me through to KOG and stage 1."}],"url":"/top-decks/february-2018/hazy-flame/kog-deck-3-by-lukecmm/"}
