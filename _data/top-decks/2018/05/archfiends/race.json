I changed to this and chaos hunters becoming a meta call it was a breeze after legend 2; Lost only once. 15 wins to legend using a more standard list with invaders but got tilted a lot in legend adjusting to the meta. Archfiends are tier 0 when you donâ€™t brick. Most of the wins after legend 2 with this current list were surrenders. Hilarious."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/archfiends/spellbooks-by-race/"}
