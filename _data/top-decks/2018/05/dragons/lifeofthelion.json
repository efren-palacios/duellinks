White night finally provides dragons a respectable boss monster to abuse with arkbrave/felgrands/dragon knight and a 2nd ruins opens up a ton of plays. No game felt linear and I felt like I found a new thing the deck could do every few duels. Took longer than I expected but I won at about a 70% rate in legend, just had some seriously bad timing losses on the ladder. Oh well, at least this makes dragons notable kog being the 3rd one of the month!"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/dragons/30-card-dragons-by-lifeofthelion/"}
