So twister, wall of D, and felgrand guard are all techs. Swapped them out for different stuff all the time depending on what I lost to lol. The rest was pretty core tho.\r\n\r\nSylvan match up was almost autowin. One you get white night out they can't do anything except Marsh leaf, which you can wrath or just take it if you can get another White out. \r\n\r\nHero's only real out to White Night is using a chalice on anki to go over it or Trinity. Didn't play too many heros but I like to think it's an ok MU.\r\n\r\nGeargias kinda easy with wrath. One you get past that initial ties they need to scramble to set up anchor again to get rid of White Night. \r\n\r\nHardest match up is fiends and spell book cuz they pop white night. Not an auto lose at all but def needs careful play. \r\n\r\nI won a lot of duels because ppl had no idea how paladin or arkbrave worked lol. Melody to discard kidmodo and then summon one of the 2 you searched is kinda dope. Didn't think ruins really shined in this after a few duels with it so I took it out."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/dragons/-by-david-blocker/"}
