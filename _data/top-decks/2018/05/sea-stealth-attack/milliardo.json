Tried a variety of decks and lost a promo, most decks werenâ€™t consistent at all...\r\nThe reason why SSA did well is because it destroys Amazoness, has a decent matchup vs Sylvans in general and also vs Masked heroes. \r\n\r\nI did play vs some Geargias, but Canadia and Abyss soldier deal with them. What can I say? Last month I KoGed with REZ, this month with SSA. Am 2 metas behind, just like Soup8?"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/sea-stealth-attack/misty-s-gym-by-milliardo/"}
