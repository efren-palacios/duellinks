Climbing was really hard as the top decks have a weird rock/scissors/paper relationship. Whenever I came close to ranking up, Spellbooks or an unlucky draw in the mirror would ruin the day. \r\n\r\nAlso, I do not have Amazoness Queen yet and my Mai never seems to drop Swordswoman. Hopefully the deck remains viable next season though!"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/sylvans/sylvans-by-zw31-4z1g/"}
