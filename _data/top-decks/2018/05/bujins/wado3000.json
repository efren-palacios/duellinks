This is an extremely inflated KoG since on my streak 2 opponents DC’d and my rank up match was literally against a 27 card SSA deck\r\nrn the best Bujin build imo is 30 cards with Grass and Ties, I own 0 Ties though so my build is firmly different. Lowered the deck to just 27 to draw Grass or Yamato more often, I don’t think the full 30 is necessary w/o Ties, tho a 28th card in a 3rd Sinyou or 1 Arasuda would work fine."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/bujins/bujins-dek-by-wado3000/"}
