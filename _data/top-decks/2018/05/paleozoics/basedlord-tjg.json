I used 8 different versions of the deck, and this was by far the best. 2x of Amulet and Wetlands was the best way to brick. Honestly, could have ran 1 more Witch and still been great. 3x Canadia was a huge asset, and if I had another Hallucigenia I would have run it. Hallowed Life Barrier is the most broken card in this deck, since you guarantee live for a turn, can discard a Paleo and special summon the same card, and you are safe from cards under the effect of Rose Lover. Chain Reaction was amazing and actually won me my rank up versus Amazoness, which is by far the most difficult match up. Can I be an expert for Paleozoics now?"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/paleozoics/paleo-diet-by-basedlord-tjg/"}
