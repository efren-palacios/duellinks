Hit  KoG in 35 ish games, but if you spread this cancer, prepare yourself to have 10 min duels to properly play vs Mash heroes, Sylvans and geargias. Archfiends are by far the worst matchup. Anyway , enjoy tilting new mask players who doesnt play around anything"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/ojama-stall/screw-mask-heros-by-vegetadl/"}
