Lost 6 games total, 3 of them in legend 3.\r\n\r\nOfferings to the Doomed was a 3rd econ thru plat, then a super Rush until legend 3 which helped a lot. Offerings won 3 of the last 5 games. Versatility allowed me to kill lava golems, Amazoness Queens and other problem monsters in awesome ways. May want to play 2 of them.\r\n\r\nTrunade was a second cyclone until legend 3. Everything else is pretty standard."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/masked-heroes/d-hero-by-genesis206/"}
