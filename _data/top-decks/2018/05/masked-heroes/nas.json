Would’ve been 15-0 if not for G R I T(seriously I hate grit with a passion) Georgias are your biggest concern. Gyokku and Hey trunade were the mvps for me.\r\n \r\nExtra Deck is 3 Anki's\r\n\r\n21 cards cause it’s obviously better then having 20 cards"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/masked-heroes/to-heck-with-grit-by-nas/"}
