I was running 3x Vyon and 2x Malicious, but I kept getting not good hands my KoG rankup matches. Deck also had a Poly instead of a Treacherous TH, but TTH won me several games. I also prefer 3x CC, since the deck can survive while you're crippling your opponent's resources."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/masked-heroes/kamen-hiro-by-kenzeppelin/"}
