Getting first KOG ever, 2. Getting KOG with a non top tier deck and 3. Getting KOG in under 35)\r\n\r\nThis deck is far from optimal but it's quite fun to use. Good MU vs Amazons, okay vs Heroes and iffy vs Sylvans. I do love using my \"own\" deck though, and I like that it doesn't really look similar to anything else on the ladder.\r\nIf I had last gamble that would be the more optimal skill"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/masked-heroes/witch-reign-by-teal/"}
