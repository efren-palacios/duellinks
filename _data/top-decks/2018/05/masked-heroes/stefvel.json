Only have 2 structure decks so I'm running an extra Decider instead of third Vyon like most people. Was running mirror wall in plat instead of treacherous then once I hit Legend I bought some sales and picked up treacherous.  Got tilted too many times in Legend 2 and 3 losing a Kog promo, eventually dropped 1 Econ and added Cyclone. The only cyclone I have put in some work for sure. Amazons were definitely my hardest match ups."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/masked-heroes/dhero-by-stefvel/"}
