I found offerings very helpful in most situations (against sylvans especially, never really drew it against amazons sadly). I rarely drew tth, but I still did very well without it. Econ was only helpful against spellbooks and archfiends, which both decks were rare to come by. I only regretted not running dreamer when against mirror, or trying to get another monster out (dreamer) for masked change for a quick win. Most loses were from amazons (probably from lack of cc), but I didnt have trouble against any other deck (only played one spellbooks, so I cant say much about that matchup)."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/masked-heroes/my-hero-academia-by-dreadeox/"}
