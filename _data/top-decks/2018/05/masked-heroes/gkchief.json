Was grinding Mai :Kappa~5: up to lv 45 on the walks home thinking once I get queen I’ll rush kog but I had trouble with the mirror and playing optimally so only made to legend 1. Got legend 2 with geargias but they started to fall off so switched to heroes and rushed in about an hour. 54 wins ain’t bad."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/masked-heroes/heroes-by-gkchief/"}
