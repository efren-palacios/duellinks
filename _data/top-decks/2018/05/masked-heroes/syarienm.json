Easiest kog i had ever had and the most fun. Just only got 3 anki yesterday. Tth can be used with destroying one of your monster and another opponent monster eg; kushmushroom and thats why more board control is important. Might be the best build so far for D. Heroes."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/masked-heroes/d-heroes-best-deck-by-syarienm/"}
