When amazoness hit I played it for a while. But in the end I decided to do it with REZ again for old time sake. after princess hit the game, heroes declined on ladder so I decided to play REZ like dinos. triple CC and double wod were cluctch vs both heroes and Amazoness. 3 skull over gozkui coz of spellbooks, onsalught and the raid of TTH. reading backrow was important. surviving Sylvans were back and forth. The enemy of this deck is bricks. don't forget, this is a NERFED DECK."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/red-eyes-zombies/-but-you-went-for-game-rez-never-dies-by-hegelianboi/"}
