Teched in a Forbidden Dress for the lols but it actually did some work. Not sure itâ€™s worth becoming a staple but certainly an interesting option that not many people seem to have been using.\r\nThree econs is essential as is three forms of negating monster effects - be it divine wrath, forbidden chalice or something else. One Chaos Hunter is also needed\r\nRestart is obvs the only viable skill at the moment. Little bit annoying - hoping Konami will change the skills up a bit in the near future to give a little more variety to duelling."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/amazoness/amazoness-by-nortycrosal/"}
