TBH Amazons are pretty consistent as they are and FITE lets you push lethal more frequently esp with your tiger plays, so restart is by no means necessary. I know for a fact the list isnt optimally tweaked cuz I wanted to jam more bastion proc'ers, but there's potential value if youre planning on running cyclone anyway. And thats 4 for 4, there's my KOG with each Bastion 1000 LP Skill. Your turn.\r\n\r\nAlso i woulda played psychics but psychics are not even close to fun to play\r\npapa corn beatdown woulda come before psychics"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/amazoness/firm-indeed-by-jeed-by-jadehex/"}
