Some brief notes. This deck went L1 to KOG. I found Econ pretty much useless. Subbed in wall of D instead, only problem was a rose lover'd Sylvan monster. Regular tiger was very handy. Also subbed in spy because I didn't have a 3rd swords women or any paladin or any sage (I'm kinda F2P, so don't spend money just Google play credit on $2 SR bundles). Also I wanted 1 other backrow hate card. Didn't think CCs cost was worth it double cyclone was meh. I literally had a game in legend where a masked hero player rage quit turn 3 after zing zen hu so I kept it after that."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/amazoness/amazoness-by-bigjake6foot5/"}
