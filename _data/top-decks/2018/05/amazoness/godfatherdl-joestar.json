Vision hero witch was pretty good to get rid of wall of d'ed monsters or extra onslaughts and clear backrow also willpower is better than rebirth cos you can search it with princess love you all and i wanna see more amazoness decks hit KoG"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/amazoness/amazoness-by-godfatherdl-joestar/"}
