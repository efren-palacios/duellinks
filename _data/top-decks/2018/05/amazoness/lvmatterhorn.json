I figured, if I've got prismatic sages + willpower, might as well use 'em.\r\n\r\nPrincess is the gal you wanna see in your hand. So versatile, you can attack with a mon, then use Princess to tag it out for Queen. Sage is probably the least useful mon but I'm running her because as I mentioned, they're prismatic. I can't say I've gotten too many useful backrow pops off of her. I'd consider even running Fighters here because getting hit with WoD is still a possibility, and very unpleasant.\r\n\r\nW1) D-heros. Banished all his resources and attacked for game.\r\nW2) Another D-heros who suffered the same fate\r\nW3) Spellbooks centred around dropping my Atk to 0 using WoD and then boosting up a single spellcaster to 4000 that was promptly thwarted by Econ\r\nW4) Masked E-heros (Neos). It didn't work\r\nW5) Destiny Calling D-heros, he got me down to 400 LP but ran out of steam"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/amazoness/amazon-hq2-in-toronto-pls-by-lvmatterhorn/"}
