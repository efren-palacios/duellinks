Just wanted to get wins as fast as possible since it's already near the end of the season but, oops. Big thanks to people in the amazoness channel for general advice, like putting in super rush and reminding me of the fact that anti magic arrows counters my own damn deck lmao Trap hole is insane and wins games on its own, super rush is a must and maybe i'd play a second chalice if i had one.  Witch raider got me out of some pinches but it can definitely be swapped out for something else, the big tiger was swapped out from a 3rd swordswoman at the start of legend 3 and it turned out to be a pretty handy tech.  this deck is too good, i gotta try out something less good next season lol..."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/amazoness/amazon-by-zombiemushmom/"}
