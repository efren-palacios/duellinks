Sphere kuriboh saved me multiple times since amazoness princess and baby tiger can be serious LP liabilities. You can always swap in cosmic cyclone for SK or chalice to have a the upper hand in the mirror match - otherwise hope you go first so you can set up onslaught before your opponent. I also feel like 3 princess and 3 onslaught are necessary as it makes the spellbook matchup easier. Most cases they can banish 2 onslaught but run out of fuel for the third.\r\nTLDR: fun deck, foxy ladies\r\nAlso, prismatic princess drop"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/amazoness/i-don-t-need-no-man-by-umi/"}
