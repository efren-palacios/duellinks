Most decks were no problem. The mirror match was annoying but is about 50/50. Really fun deck. Mostly just go the amazoness route but the massivemorph/amazoness swordsman combo came in handy plenty of times. Highly recommend!"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/amazoness/lava-amazoness-by-poopinblanks/"}
