Was originally playing 2 lash 2 tiger, swapped 1 of each to another paladin and econ. Lash was neat for playing more aggressively with t1 princess going 2nd. Theoretically opens up some neat swords woman plays though that didn't come up much."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/amazoness/amazon-by-silchasruin/"}
