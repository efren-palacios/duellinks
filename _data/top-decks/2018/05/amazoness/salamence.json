I encountered quite some Ojama/Extra Extra Burn decks but weirdly never lost once (even when my opponent summoned 3 Lava golems to my side) , so even though it's supposed to be a hard matchup, there is still room for plays which can make you win the game, which is why I love this deck. I still find myself noticing small misplays so I can still learn more about the deck (which isn't the case with more braindead decks.. looking at you sylvans)"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/amazoness/amazoness-by-salamence/"}
