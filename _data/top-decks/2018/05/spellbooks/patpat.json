The deck has a learning curve, took me around 40 wins with this deck to get there . Lyla works surprisingly well and Monster Gate can win you games on it's own, it's not uncommon to mill 15 cards even if you don't open with Grass."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/spellbooks/grass-lyla-2-blue-no-life-by-patpat/"}
