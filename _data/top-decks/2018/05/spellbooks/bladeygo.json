Ran 2 hole because the cards broken, and typically you only see 1 per duel. Played grit instead of restart because The deck is already consistent enough. Barely lost, Sylvans were easy, fool engine was super powerful, and overall was a very easy kog, no offense to anyone I played against."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/spellbooks/gritbooks-by-bladeygo/"}
