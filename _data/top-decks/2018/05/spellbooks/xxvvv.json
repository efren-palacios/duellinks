Tried Magical Marionette, it was not as good as I thought. Finally decided to run 3 fool 2 crescent for the turn 1 reaper combo. I run 2 destroyer and 1 reaper, because the chance they are milled to GY is greater than the chance they are drawed, and destroyer in GY is so much better then reaper in GY. I almost never want to draw either destroyer or reaper.\r\nI also tried the tricky. It never helped me, and I always want a fool or destoryer instead."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/spellbooks/dat-glass-luks-gleener-by-xxvvv/"}
