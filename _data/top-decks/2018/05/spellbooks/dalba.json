Felt like this Deck was really consistent, with fate completely shutting down different decks at times. Of course with that, this deck can get crushed by Chaos Hunter. Other losses are because of misplays. All in all, very strong deck but requires a lot more thought in what you need to set up/do. \r\nDEATH TO SYLVANS"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/spellbooks/tricky-spellbook-by-dalba/"}
