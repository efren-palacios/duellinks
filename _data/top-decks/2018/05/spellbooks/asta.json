Problem is anything can get over Blue Boy. So I added Fool. And a copy of DMOC. 28k Def is relevant as most decks can’t beat over it. TTH is a great card. Every game I resolved it I won. So I really tried to keep the deck count close to 20. Organization is a spell book card, and you can set it along Fate. Since most ppl are running CC. They won’t be as trigger happy. Stacking is just a plus. All 5 games from L3 to KOG were vs Amazon."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/spellbooks/blue-boy-control-by-asta/"}
