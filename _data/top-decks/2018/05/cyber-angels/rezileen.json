This deck will remain relevant on the ladder as long as Sylvans are popular. It seems like a lot of Amazoness decks are also dropping ECon for Chalice and SRH due to the mirror, making them more manageable for CA.\r\n\r\nTreacherous Trap Hole (TTH) is pretty clutch vs. Amazoness, Heroes, and overall in general. I had one game where I managed to chain 2 TTHs vs. an Amazoness deck and wiped their entire frontrow.\r\n\r\nUse Alexis and prismatic Dakini + MAAR for good luck\r\n\r\n#CAisdead #freedakini #natashawhen"}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/cyber-angels/sephora-angels-by-rezileen/"}
