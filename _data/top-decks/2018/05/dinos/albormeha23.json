I am a good dino duelist so for me its might have been easier to reach KOG. \r\n\r\nNormally, I dont get KOG this early in the season but I got triggered from a tourney and did this run with dinos in legend  3 went 5-0.\r\n\r\nDinos are actually good, people sleep on them. Not top tier but still viable with the backrow in this slow meta. Dino channel for more discussion.  I do have another secret build which is good.\r\n\r\nThanks to @tekumse - Dino Expert for listening to my stupid ideas haha. I apologise."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/dinos/angry-deck-by-albormeha23/"}
