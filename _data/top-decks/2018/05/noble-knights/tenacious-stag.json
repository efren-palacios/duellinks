Was working with an 8 monster variant, but cutting them for econs made a big difference. A third Drystan will make your life a lot easier, but I only had 2 to work with. Got lucky with my Medraut pulls. All you need in hand is a monster, quick play, and equip spell. Only use the equips you need to avoid clogging your backrow and stay on top of your toggle plays."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/noble-knights/noble-bros-by-tenacious-stag/"}
