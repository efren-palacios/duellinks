It was workable to replace a Bedwyr with a third Drystan but Bedwyr’s ability to move equip cards was MVP of some matches. I even use Bedwyr’s first effect to thin the deck when I need a monster occasionally. I didn’t lose a single match to Sylvans after adding a second Arfeudutyr - basically having 5 of them due to the ability to search them out with Glory. I also didn’t lose a single match to Amazons with 3 Double Cyclones. My worst matchup has been a fast Masked Hero deck with opening hand removal. But in closing, I would just like to give a quick message to Sylvans... don’t let the door hit you in the butt on the way out."}],"url":"/top-decks/may-2018/noble-knights/knoble-crackers-by-thecabledude/"}
