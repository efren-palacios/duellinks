Only one rebirth is not good so would replace the spiritual art card with rebirth if u have em. The idea with magnets is that u mill the small guys for big plays. If ur valk dies u got Gaia plate and snipe hunter so it ain't too bad. Remember: if deltas on the field and vanillas beta/ electro betas are going in the grave ur doing something right."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/magnet-warriors/-by-kelso/"}
