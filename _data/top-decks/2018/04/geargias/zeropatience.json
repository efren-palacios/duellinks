This deck is really consistent and powerful. Definitely worthy of being a tier 1 deck. \r\n\r\nI went from platinum 4 to legend undefeated and only suffered 4 losses while in legend. 3 of which were due to bad rng on my end and one due to clicking on a freshly summoned anchor instead of the one that was already on the board.\r\n\r\nThe only 2 things that I would change about the deck is replacing the 2 super rush headlong for one more ties of the brethren and forbidden chalice if I had them. Mainly because over half of my matches were against sylvans and being able to negate a komushroomo can be clutch to winning the match. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing about the deck."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/geargias/gear-up-and-move-out-by-zeropatience/"}
