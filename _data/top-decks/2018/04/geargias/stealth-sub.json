This deck crushes everything but Sylvans, but I guess it has a fighting chance against them too.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I would change anything, this list is basically optimal imo. A 3rd ties would be good, but the only thing I'd drop for it would be either Chalice (which clutched out many games) or an attacker (which I find 2 is the sweetspot in running, since 3 = dead hands)"}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/geargias/just-remove-sylvans-from-the-game-already-by-stealth-sub/"}
