Honestly wouldâ€™ve played more Brethren if I had them. The deck played really well. Definitely needs balance. Bricked a ton trying other skills. Sylvans and Cyber Angels can be tough, especially if Sylvans go first. Overall I like the matchup against almost everything else. Especially Aliens. It destroys Aliens."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/geargia/-by-conan/"}
