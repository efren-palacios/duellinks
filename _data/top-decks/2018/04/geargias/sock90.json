Finally did it on the 43th win.\r\nThe deck have some potential, but there are 2 big problems: Divine Wrath and the fact that people can't read the cards. I won some games just because my opponent thought they could just do Whale on Geargianchor. \r\nThat wont last long.\r\nBtw, I'm gonna play it tomorrow on my stream :^)"}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/geargia/-by-sock90/"}
