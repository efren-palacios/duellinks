Decided to try Destiny Draw variant. Rosemary, Snipe Hunter and Parallel Twister are good against Sylvans. I would've get to KoG faster but my brain decided to stop working 4 times on a rank up match. This deck always has OTK potential which helps against hard matchups and D-Draw is certainly a good skill for that. For some time I tried Spell Absorbing Life but it's only good for Jasmine and heal is negligible so I went with Powerful Rebirth. It's good for stopping plays while giving you much needed setup. Aegis+Rosemary at the right time allow you to do some cheesy plays even against monsters unaffected by traps. Sometimes activating Aegis before any battle can bait opponent that doesn't have lethal to skip Battle Phase because they're afraid of giving you D-Draw allowing you to live for more turns than you should've."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/aromages/-by-mrnishi/"}
