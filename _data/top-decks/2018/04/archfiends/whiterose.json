Took me from lvl 10-20 in kc cup stage 1 easily (didnt really play Stage 2) as well. Lylaâ€™s destroy facedown effect came in handy many times before setting up a big emperor play. Fiend Griefing is such a good tech especially in this meta - Most effectively used to send Rose Lover, CarrotWeight, Dhero Celestial, Fishborg, or any fuel for MAAR back to the deck - then put an Emperor in the GY. Used Archfiend Roar during opponents end phase to bring back calvary or empress- then when destroyed, bought Emperor back from GY. Restart skill to have a mill card + archfiend roar/Call in the first hand."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/archfiends/archfiend-mill-by-whiterose/"}
