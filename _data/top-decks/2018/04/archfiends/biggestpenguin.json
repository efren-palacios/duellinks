If you don’t set a divine wrath or ult prov against this deck, (providing you kept the correct hand) it will eat your corpse.  It has a hard time against SSA because it’s got no way to deal with a live whale, other than that, emp and empress are bigger than trees, faster than gears and relinkuriboh is a win condition. Just play it and you’ll see. It’s very sacky, but just play out every game and odds are you’ll explode, raining gore upon the fields of needlebugs, masticating on the corpses of lesser players."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/archfiends/archfizzle-by-biggestpenguin/"}
