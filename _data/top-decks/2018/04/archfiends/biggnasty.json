Boss monsters every turn! Lyla is a nice tech for a free spell removal to set up emperor OTK's. I originally didnt like needle bug but with restart you need atleast 1 needle bug in your starting hand for the the most consistent plays (fiend griefing works if you know its masked heroes, sylvan, or CA). 3 cavalry is a must to use Roar, 2 empress is a must (3 is doable). I'd rate this deck a 7/10 for performance but 9/10 for fun. Very few tilt matches except when needle bug tosses 3CoA and 2 Roar in the GY. gg ez claps"}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/archfiends/-by-biggnasty/"}
