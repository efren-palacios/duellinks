Ideally you'll have a way to mill in your opening hand for a strong turn 3/4. \r\n\r\nThe deck has a lot of combos, like popping Roar on either Empress or Cavalry in the end phase to summon Emperor, and then using Emperor to pop cards. You can even use Emperor to pop your own Empress/Cavalry, and then special summon another Emperor. Bacon Saver is decent, it's especially good vs Mask Change DHeroes, Sylvans, and Cyber Angels. \r\n\r\nThis deck is extremely strong vs Sylvans, I didn't lose any games to Sylvans on the ladder (and Sylvans were probably 60% of my duels) because you can just destroy their Kumoshroom or Magical Merchant. Then they'll probably try to mill with Marshaleaf, and you can chain your traps if they mill Kumoshroom, or sometimes they mill a Marshaleaf and kill Cavalry/Empress allowing you to special summon Emperor."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/archfiends/archfiends-by-noogle/"}
