This is the built that I reached KoG with. I like playing the control game, which is why I tried to do it without Ties Of The Brethren (which I will test out now at the KC-Cup Stage 1)\r\nI also tested Forbidden Chalice during my climb, but ultimately kicked it in favour of the rebirths.\r\nPulse Mines buys whole turns vs CA, Masked Heroes and partially Sylvans; which is often the time you need to start your engines."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/geargia/geargia-by-rupert/"}
