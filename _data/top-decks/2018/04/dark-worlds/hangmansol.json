Went with Sylvans first but after 2 promo losses and a CA, Hazy god hands, and mirror match brick fest fueled tilt back to L1 figured f-it, try to win turn 2 or 3 every game. Originally the 2 trunades were SK's but after looking at the other 2 decks on the website I liked AlexNZ's inclusion of the trunades as a more win-now card, they definitely helped more than the SK's were. Not many bricks surprisingly, most of the few losses it took with this were going first and getting OTK'd round 2 by waiting, but even those were few. Dealt with Sylvans very well."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/dark-worlds/drk-world-by-hangmansol/"}
