Had to run 3 chalice in my fishes and aliens decks just for the annoying sylvans. Then I lost my patience and switched to sylvans myself.\r\nI feel like 3 S/Ts are enough. 5 is too much for me. Milling S/Ts is a huge waste. The skill is restart. I usually use restart to search for a S/T. All the three S/Ts can send carrot/rose to GY, which is super useful."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/sylvans/-by-xxvvv/"}
