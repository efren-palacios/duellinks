Went 10-0 from Legend 2, but wasn’t given the KoG rank-up and on the next game lost to SSA (this deck’s biggest weakness). In a tournament you’d probably side 3x CC for SSA and ways to help against Geargias. Maybe has Tier 3 potential again. Anyway after losing to SSA I got annoyed and finished it off with Sylvans.\r\nBoth pretty standard builds"}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/sylvans/the-learning-center-by-superforms/"}
