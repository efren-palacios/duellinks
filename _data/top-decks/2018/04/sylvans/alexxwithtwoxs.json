Fragrance storm is almost an auto win when you pull it in the mirror match (which is basically half of the duels I played in legend, so it was worth it to tech one) Grit is pretty much standard for Sylvans now. Also, it drives me crazy when people call this a brain dead deck. If you are a skilled player and can make good reads, you can create a huge advantage for yourself by stacking your deck with the effects of hermitree and guardioak. Much more effective than saying yes to shroom and hoping RNGeesus does it all for you. Final note, the pro play is hard bluff carrot turn one or two if you're assuming your opponent has monster removal. They'll either waste resources to get rid of it (and you survive with grit if they try to OTK) or they don't attack and you tribute it off, summon it again ditching rose, etc etc"}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/sylvans/grit-sylvans-kog-by-alexxwithtwoxs/"}
