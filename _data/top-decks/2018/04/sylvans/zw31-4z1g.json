On the one side, I'm pretty glad that Konami gives us f2p people a way to participate, on the other side, the mirror can become quite tedious. The list I used is from tommymon's video on the kc cup and I'm pretty pleased with it. Restart is a must I think, or you sometimes cannot really interact with your opponents. The Lotuswain is nice, as it allows you to cycle through your deck multiple times and win grindy games. All in all, I was pleased how much every decision matters and you can certainly gain an edge if you play well."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/sylvans/sylvans-by-zw31-4z1g/"}
