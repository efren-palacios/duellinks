Of course I admit it to the meta and tried 3 paleos to go overboard and check if there are situations where Econ is better then this.. if felt like there wasn’t that much situations.. often I just had to protect second or third turn to get an easy and early whale out and if you activate sSa you can summon paleo from grave so u don’t have an open field next round .. pretty solid deck!"}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/sea-stealth-attack/mako-water-by-janko777/"}
