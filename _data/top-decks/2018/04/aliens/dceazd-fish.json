I wanted to have fun, playing Sylvans and it was great from P4 till L2. And then I faced A WHOLE LOAD OF CYBER ANGELS NO-BRAIN DECKS, like... 10 in a row? So I switched to aliens and lost only twice - to Whale and to Sylvans. Interesting, that I never used WOD, so better swap it for Super Rush Headlong or Forbidden Chalice, to Counter better Whale or Sylvans\r\n\r\nSkill is Balance"}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/aliens/alien-by-dceazd-fish/"}
