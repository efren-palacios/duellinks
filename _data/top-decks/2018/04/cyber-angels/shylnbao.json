Also I only had two Senju and that is why I was running two only. I put two Gishki Chain for two reasons: first is I do not have other ritual support monster, second is a lot of Mask Hero Decks are running deciders. Every time my first main account was playing against Mask Hero, I had a hard time playing since I did not have any thing to get rid of two Deciders, so running two Gishki Chain helped a lot. Also I had 14 win streak before KOG if I was not wrong. Sometimes do not be afraid to be OTKed because Grit helps a lot when you are full LP."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/cyber-angels/ca-by-shylnbao/"}
