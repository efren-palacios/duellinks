Same deck I used to get dl20. Only change made was -1 senju +1 sprite's to test and it consistency raised a lot(almost never bricked or was unable to comeback back) Not using trunade since it drops consistency and faced a few decks with heavy backrow and almost 0 WoD. Providence was a little annoying but no big problems to play around it. Gishiki chan is really amazing the true MVP in many games."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/cyber-angels/-by-hellquyncy/"}
