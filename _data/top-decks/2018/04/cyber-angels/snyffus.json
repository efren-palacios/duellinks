The fast wins against Archfiends, Sylvans and Water secured an easy KoG. Right now this deck has too many problems. Both Geargia and Masked HERO require a changed build because this one is consistent but not powerful enough to combat both Match-Ups. I tried different builds but they are either not powerful or not consistent enough to actually have a good winrate. While its not very good right now when I got KoG a week ago it was the best choice for the ladder."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/cyber-angels/balance-saffira-ca-by-snyffus/"}
