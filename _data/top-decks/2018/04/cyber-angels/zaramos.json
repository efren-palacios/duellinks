Stack your Trunade or whatever you need next and get a free spell/LVL 8 light Fairy for OTK next turn. Going 2nd you most likely win. Harder MA: Anything that summons more than 1 monster per turn (In some cases you get 2 Dakini summons per turn to OTK through 2 monsters). Really fast games (up to 20/hour)! Will use it for Stage 2 ;)"}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/cyber-angels/dakini-sb-by-zaramos/"}
