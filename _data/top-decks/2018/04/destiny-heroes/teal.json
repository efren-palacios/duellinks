This shits just absurdly broken, it has favorable MU against like, every single deck. 36 wins from Plat 4 -> KoG but every single loss aside from 1 was while playing REZ or Sylvan. This deck had 1 loss total in Legend and it was a D-Hero Mirror. Konami got a problem on their hands because these  rough drafts of decks are still so incredibly good\r\nI don't have another Chalice or I'd be running it over a WoD"}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/destiny-heroes/the-hero-returns-by-teal/"}
