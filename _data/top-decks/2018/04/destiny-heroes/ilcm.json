Pretty cheeky, everyone plays around mask change and the heavy backrow makes it easy to deal with most of the current top tier decks, the real mvp being the double floodgate. Easy wins against cyber angel, masked heroes and sylvans, the hardest match up being Archfiends! Played against almost no geargias but everytime the duel was a breeze, floodgate usually sealing the deal in most games, especially after ties was used!"}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/destiny-heroes/d-hero-beatdown-by-ilcm/"}
