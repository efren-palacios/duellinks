Deck is pretty solid. Played more of a control version. Beat all the meta decks, but I will admit that I got pretty lucky vs Sylvans, twice (they milled terribly). The deck is fun and works well. If you have 3 Anki, play 3. Only having two almost cost me the game in one of my matches"}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/destiny-heroes/maskedhero-s-by-zebigcheese/"}
