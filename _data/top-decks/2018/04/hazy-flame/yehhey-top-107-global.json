REMEMBER do NOT get greedy and use hazy effect if you don't need to vs sylvans you don't wanna get wrathed if you already have your BR combo set.\r\n\r\nnow ssa is of course a weakness demoted me from legend 3 several times and its hard to predict what you'll play but i was cycling cyclones in and out of the deck if i felt it was time ssa would pop up. this deck pretty much beats everything else at least 50/50 except ssa. ca matchup is surprisingly even as well with swamp eating up dakini effect and frequently leaving you with a 39k br'ed hazy. this deck deserves way more testing since the release of swamp mirorrer as it makes boosted beaters with ease in a meta where people are still running 3 econ and even sometimes chalice on top of that."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/hazy-flame/hazy-crazy-savage-by-yehhey-top-107-global/"}
