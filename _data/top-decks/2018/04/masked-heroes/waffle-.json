(And the most expensive). Took me around 390 cards from the new box before I got all 3 Anki's that I needed. No luck whatsoever with the free UR's. This deck is amazing in the current meta although you have to be wary of what your opponent sets depending on the deck they're using. I only ran into a few issues against backrow heavy decks, although most of the time the deck pulled through for me. Destiny calling saved my bacon quite a few times and the satisfaction I got when I put out a decider against cyber angels was priceless. Overall, 9,5/10 deck for me."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/masked-heroes/masked-hero-by-waffle/"}
