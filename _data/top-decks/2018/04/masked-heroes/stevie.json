I'm a big fan of Little City from the TCG so I just decided to challenge myself for fun. I also ran a variant with Alius and Field of the Warriors because he can actually run over Komush, but Mask Change into Vapor is already a good out for that deck. This is strictly inferior to the Destiny HERO version, but Ocean is a really good card that has better recursion than the other deck."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/masked-heroes/elemental-hero-little-city-by-stevie/"}
