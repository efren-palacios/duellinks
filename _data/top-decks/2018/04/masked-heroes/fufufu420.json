My rank up gems actually got me my 3rd Anki which was great. \r\nI also played this deck in the KC Cup and though I couldn't play as much as I'd like to have due to work, this deck allowed me to rank higher than I ever had, reaching around 20k at my highest.\r\nThe reason I love this deck is due to it's similar play style to 3SD Ninjas, which was my prior favorite deck. It's extremely powerful with a wide range of plays that you can make, with you being able to make multiple plays per turn. Each card holds lots of value. \r\nTook a few games to get the hang of the deck down, but once I had it down it was an easy 5 games."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/masked-heroes/mali-hero-by-fufufu420/"}
