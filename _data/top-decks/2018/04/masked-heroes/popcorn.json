Bait out their backrow if you can then Mask Change.\r\n(Powerful Rebirth and DDraw can probably get swapped out, but I like 'em for some reason... Rebirth lets you pop Vylon again to dump another Hero, or you can bring out Decider with it and pop it's effect to recover something, and then discard it with Dangerous to dump another D Hero.)\r\nRestart is the way to play. I really love the way you can set up in different ways in anticipation of what your opponent might be playing.\r\nI see some people putting Drilldark in their decks... I don't understand why they think it's a good monster.\r\nThis deck is all about thinning down to get to your power Spells, and Drilldark doesn't do anything to contribute. He needs to get a job, move out, and stop leaching off of his parents."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/masked-heroes/face-transplant-by-popcorn/"}
