I got from Platinum Rank 4-5 fairly easily with Dark World Emperor Hybrid but in Legend there are so many CAs, Sylvans, SSAs, Flying Fish. I tried my hand with CA, Dark World Emperor and Flying Fishes. D-Hero was able to sustain only three loss (briiiiicky city) for 20 wins L1-KOG. My KOG promo match was a Life Cost 0. Couldn't attack my Decider any ways and Masked Change for Direct Damage cucks. Faced 3 SSA and a DW deck for 5 games in L3-KOG to win it early with 70 games on the dot. I usually average 200 games a season ore more for KOG. I was testing the build that Kazaaras made and some minor tweak on my side. Didn't think I hit KOG so fast on it."}],"url":"/top-decks/april-2018/masked-heroes/new-destiny-by-kingswagbodi/"}
