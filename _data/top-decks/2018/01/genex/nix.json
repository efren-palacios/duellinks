Brillant use of genex searcher and powerful rebirth. Used it from Legend 1 all the way to KOG with no switching, I was just having fun with the deck then the next thing I knew I was in KOG. Basic combo is set searcher and rebirth. Let searcher die, SS turbine, then powerful rebirth the searcher. It comes back as a level 5 with 2100 atk because of turbine. Now you can use beatdown because powerful rebirth brought it back as a level 5. The rest of the deck really doesn't need explaining."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/genex/genex-2-0-by-nix/"}
