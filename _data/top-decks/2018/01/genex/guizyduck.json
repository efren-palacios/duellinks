Instead of defaulting to the op decks, I decided to hit KoG with this Genex deck. Inspiration came from the top 16 genex deck in meta weekly, but I decided to play my own take on it. This version relies on Sleight of Hand, Electro and backrows to stall until Army comes out to finish the game. Overall, a super fun deck that I’d recommend anyone play, since I believe it’ll be even stronger post-banlist."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/genex/genex-by-guizyduck/"}
