This is the balance I've settle on as most reliable; the goal with this deck is to get out Sphynx, then decide whether to move in or wait for Beast Rising based on what your facing and what your reads on the back row are. Whenever I don't want a card I see with Aroma I shuffle using Sphynx's ability. I wasn't sure about the Econs at first, and they end up as dead cards in the mirror, but they can be essential on your first turn keeping something alive to sacrifice for Sphynx/Peryton/Cerberus second turn, and they can be used to Econ take  and sacrifice; in my rankup game I faced an AG/GB deck who got AGG out their second turn, but I took it sac'd for the win."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/hazy-flame/hazy-by-roosta/"}
