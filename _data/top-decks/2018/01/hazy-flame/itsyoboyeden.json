Very easy road to KOG, econ deals with bs like CA and Bamboo trash.\r\nMissed MCS last month because I stayed in legend to test, so this month I knew I was gonna hit KOG right away. \r\nWould be too difficult to hit KOG with Aroma Strat with all the CA and Ninjas going around.\r\nHazy -> tier 1 after ban list & skills rebalancing imo"}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/hazy-flame/3sd-hazies-by-itsyoboyeden/"}
