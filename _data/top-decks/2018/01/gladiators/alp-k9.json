I tried to stay in legend to test a lot of builds but the ladder is garbage rn and will still until day 24 and the bamboo banlist. So thatâ€™s all, unfortunately only really tested mindscan x shadow game, still in love with mind scan and probably will still playing it after the nerf."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/gladiators/gladiators-by-alp-k9/"}
