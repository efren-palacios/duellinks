Opponents often attacked set GB which can be game winning.\r\n- skip opponents draw phase can be huge \r\n- parasite is a great attack target even for murmillo\r\n- forces a face up monster on opponents side. Makes e-con take with golem easy\r\n- reduces tea burn consistency by making deck 21/22 cards\r\n-1000 damage can win games.\r\n\r\nDownside of weevil:\r\n- lower starting hand consistency vs balance but I only bricked twice. GB has good brick recovery.\r\n- not as much burn potential as shadow game\r\n- harder to play around back row without minds can but not an issue if you note prompts."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/gladiators/brexit-strategy-by-brenduke/"}
