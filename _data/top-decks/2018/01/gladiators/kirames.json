Climbed from L1-KOG with this deck. Triple ECON did well vs CA and triple floodgate worked very well vs REZ to slow them down and prevent AMA plays, I stopped seeing Hazy so i took out SRH. Cyclone and Gyokkou were my tech cards against Ninja but proved useful in most match-ups.\r\n\r\nShout out to the 2 bamboo players who went 1st and bricked on my 5 game streak to KOG as well as the final boss who chose to surrender turn 1."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/gladiators/gladiators-by-kirames/"}
