The main issue I had was against Dakini, I'm glad that's getting nerfed.\r\n\r\nMy main issue was against 3SD Hazy Flame when they explode and I often found myself using Essidari to hold them back or to get over their bigger monster.\r\n\r\nThe addition of Wall of Disrespect really worked out for me. Windstorm was decent but I often ended up having it at the worst time, while I found myself loving every second with this card.\r\n\r\nI am now a 6th time KoG player and an F2P one at that, and I have all of you to thank for it.\r\n\r\nMy last duel before I got promoted was a Tea Bamboo and I was on the brink with 500 LP and  it felt good to see them surrender."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/gladiator-beasts/avatar-spirit-beasts-by-dreadknight/"}
