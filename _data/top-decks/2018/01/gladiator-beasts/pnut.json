Was my first time using Glads so it took me a bit to learn.  Messed around with ETH without even knowing it was bugged.  Went back to Balance for better consistency for my Leg 3 to KoG rank up.  XZH was very hit or miss, it was really good early game, but was rarely ever useful late game."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/gladiator-beasts/furry-convention-by-pnut/"}
