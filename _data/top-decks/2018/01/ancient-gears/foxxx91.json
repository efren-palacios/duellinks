So dinos brought me to legend3 and then i lost a kog promo match. I was frustated and switched a little bit around (GB with every skill, Hazys, Ninjas) and then i found AG again, after loosing 1 KOG rank up match against Dinos i tried it another time after deck changes from members of this discord here and finally got KOG again. 4 Star lady bug was gold against GB and parasites Weevil."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/ancient-gears/ancient-machines-by-foxxx91/"}
