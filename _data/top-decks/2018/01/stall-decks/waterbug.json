I know, it hurts to not have a 20 card deck), but I felt it was necessary for helping mill the opponent if they were trying to stall as well.  Jar of Avarice also helps a lot when people realize what you are trying to do.  Gladiators have a good match-up versus this deck as they can keep one monster on the field and keep cycling/constantly cycle the Essedarii to keep their deck count the same indefinitely.  This also has good match-ups versus Weevil and DDraw burn which I ran into a fair number of on the climb.  Don't recommend this for everyone since it usually means long 30-40 turn games, but I was tilted and wanted to tilt others so I stuck with it to KOG."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/stall-decks/temple-tilt-by-waterbug/"}
