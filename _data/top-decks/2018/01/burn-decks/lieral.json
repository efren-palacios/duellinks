Cursed Bamboo's bounce effect also lets him hit directly for 1700 if convenient.\r\n-3 Iron Blacksmith Kotatsu to search out Cursed Bamboo Sword or even Sword of Deep-Seated to avoid topdecking it.\r\n-2 Lava Golem with Ante are anti-swarm + more burn.\r\n-1 Magical Mallet to circumvent some ded hands.\r\n-Sword of Deep-Seated can be a quick 1k burn on opponent's End Phase (since you draw the sword again), and enables Jars of Avarice if you happen to empty your deck.\r\n-2 Rainbow Life to deny/heal damage over one whole turn.\r\n-2 Jars of Avarice to recycle Bamboo first and other cards second.\r\n-Curse of Anubis as a general defense in a rampant effect monster meta.\r\n-Type Zero Magic Crusher is your main form of attack.
