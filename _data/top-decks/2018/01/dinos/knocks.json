Only been playing for a month so it's missing some cards I'd love to add (Fossil Dig/Chalice/another Floodgate). Initially had 2x Metalmorph instead of SRH but found SRH more useful, and had 2x XZH as well but vs most decks in Legend it felt like a dead draw."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/dinos/h-y-d-r-o-g-e-d-d-o-n-by-knocks/"}
