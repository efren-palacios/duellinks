Because I didn't want to get to KoG really, I've decided to try Jurrac's which I would later try to get KoG on stream.\r\n\r\nWell, I got LUCKY and went on a 5 win streak with this  JURRAC deck. Don't expect to win alot with it though, I doubt I could do a full legend climb with it. Well, so late to the season it might be possible."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/dinos/jurracs-by-timo-phenom/"}
