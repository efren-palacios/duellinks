The deck struggled against CA and ninjas (unless the ninja player ran into mirror wall for no reason), but did surprisingly well against red-eyes and glads and decent against hazy. Before the CA nerf this deck struggled, but after the nerf it did pretty well and got me from legend 2 to kog in no time. Still wouldn't recommend this deck to climb though, i did it for the memes and because i like dark magician."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/dark-magician/magician-s-rod-by-yanos33/"}
