Thanks a lot to @King Arthur for the decklist (didn't have a 2nd MW unfortunately)\r\n\r\nIt is of course late in the month so there was mostly a lot of random stuff on the ladder, so its hard to see how competitive the deck truly is. However, the few times that I did come across REZ or Hazy, I was often able to defeat them through forcing Spririts and destroying Beast Risings with Dark Magic Attack. The double summon build in with Jester makes for some really nice plays too."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/dark-magician/dark-magician-by-maurits/"}
