I think it is at least tier 2.5 or 2 cuz i destroyed almost every tier 2/3 deck like AG, glads, dinos ect. Hardest match ups  were CA cuz they drew like gods and hazy, but only if i couldn't clear beast rising, same weakness as 3sd ninjas"}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/ninjas/no-3sd-feel-free-by-3-de/"}
