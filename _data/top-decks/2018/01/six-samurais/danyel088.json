I was hoping for bamboo shit to end, but unfortunately it looks that it will hold until the end of the season....\r\n\r\nThis decks was working fine... Only real problems I got with this was hazy and 3sd ninja, but econs can be changed for srh to help that. For the other decks in general, I think this build can work around then."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/six-samurais/six-sam-by-danyel088/"}
