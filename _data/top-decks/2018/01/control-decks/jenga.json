Impenetrable Attack is just so annoying so I added it.\r\nCosmic cyclone is useful for the End Phase and can trigger Skyscraper.\r\nA second Floodgate would be better but I don’t have it. Wall of D should get kicked for that imo.\r\nMirror Wall tiggers Skyscraper and protects a second turn making it pretty good in this deck. The 3rd one could be replaced.\r\n\r\nThe deck is probably not good to win a MCS as sooner or later you’ll loose due to a brick monster hand. For a KC cup is seems ok though as it can deal with a large range of decks.\r\nThe skill buff would have helped occasionally. I don’t think it will make the deck that much better though."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/control-decks/hero-control-by-jenga/"}
