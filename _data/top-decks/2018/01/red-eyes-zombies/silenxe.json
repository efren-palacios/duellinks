I tried to hit KOG with shadow game glad beats and failed miserably so I went back to CA but i could not get that 5th kog game and got de ranked to leg 2. So i switched to our \"tier 1\" deck and I was able to hit kog with around 11 games. Kog rank up match was the mirror, but he misplayed by wasting his 2 econs and trying to go for gg and he forgot i had some good bacon in the graveyard."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/red-eyes-zombies/2rez-by-silenxe/"}
