With hazy flame, Glad Beasts and Burn running wild I opted for this variant and until I test the latest cards from the new box this’ll probably be what I take into KC Cup. Went 20-5 with it on my way to KOG with the main losses being to my opponents either opening with the Woodland combo or one jabroni Top decking a dimensional warrior. Super Rush has overtaken E-Con in my eyes and is the most important card in the battle phase now due to it checking wall of D as well as absolutely destroying Hazy decks. Can sometimes “Brick” but the engine of this deck is so strong and it doesn’t take long to gain back supremacy. Storm is the obvious mvp though as it literally destroys stall/burn and clears an easy path to victory. Not your conventional REZD build; but don’t knock no e-con until you actually try it"}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/red-eyes-zombies/omae-wa-mo-shindeiru-by-daddy-dingo-the-verd/"}
