Forget anyone who runs floodgate and disruption. I was stuck in plat 5 for around 100 games for some reason with the standard red eyes build for beat down. I finally got out and then had a smooth ride to legend 3 then starting dealing with a lot of control. I tried using Ross' tournament Phoenix build to deal with the back row but I found myself either bricking or dying too quickly/ not having the tools to close certain matchups. I got sick of it and decided to stop respecting people's back row since most of the time playing around things that aren't there can put you at a disadvantage. Lo and behold a few SMorc games later and I'm KoG.\r\nTy @Anthoknee , @Insano - REZ Expert and @Ross for the help!\r\n\r\nBtw ran 3 red eyes for maximum one shot potential with gozuki combos."}],"url":"/top-decks/january-2018/red-eyes-zombies/the-chad-zombie-by-mychemicalrotations/"}
