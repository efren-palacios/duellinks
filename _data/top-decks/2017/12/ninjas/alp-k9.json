Mind scan helped a lot in this random ladder, seriously, I was being tilt because of summoned bestiari into wild tornado. I hated chalice, was always a -2 for me cuz I always had to spend another card to protect my monster, half shut helped a lot in ninjas and electros matchup, I missed Impenstrable attack only in the CA matchup, but my backrow already have 8 cards to deal with them, so... Got twice into kog promo with gladiators then demoted myself to L1 to practice a bit with Ninjas."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/ninjas/dkayed-daddy-by-alp-k9/"}
