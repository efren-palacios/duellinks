Definitely has issues with ninjas still but I only faced one on my climb. A toss up vs. CA, mostly due to floodgate/econ but the double fusion being able to get over a floodgated dakini proved very useful as well. This deck annihilates dd burn and never felt even close to losing vs the many of those I faced. All you have to do is not trigger ddraw, destroy that field spell with bestiari (floodgate rabbit/sky for a non damage GB attack) and easy victory. This deck is above rez imo, and is tier 2 by itself. The revival trap was for testing and really only helped in 2-3 duels and most cases another dimacari would have worked there honestly. Overall, 9.5/10, would play again."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/gladiator-beasts/glad-you-came-by-lifeofthelion/"}
