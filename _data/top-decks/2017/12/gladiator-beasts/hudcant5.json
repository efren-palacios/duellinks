Ninjas were pretty easy if you play around their hand count. CA is dumb easy. AG was a cake walk so was burn. The only tough match up was the mirror match.  Tier 2 for the win. Props to swordfish111 for instilling faith in me with the holy guard it got I went on a huge streak to legend 3 then used mind scan the last 2 just to make sure I didn’t misplay.. I don’t own a 3rd laquari or floodgate so don’t ask."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/gladiator-beasts/defensive-gb-by-hudcant5/"}
