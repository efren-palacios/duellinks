I got to about legend 3 with only 1 laquari somehow, but Id definitely run 3 if I had it, likely replace the 2nd Dimicari with it. I felt like the art of twos worked better with my main spell/trap lineup 2 Floodgate and WOD for the pesky hazy matchup plus a random SRH since tonight I actually faced 6 hazy in a row. CC is nice because without mindscan it lets you get rid of a random facedown that might actually hurt you if you attacked with a glad before tagging out. Could swap out the walls for mirror walls, but again did not have them. Not the most optimal deck but it did what I needed it to do."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/gladiator-beasts/tier-1-incoming-by-anthoknee/"}
