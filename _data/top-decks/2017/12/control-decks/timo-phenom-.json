The electros and disciples share same threat in opponents eyes (you don't want your enemy to have the card on the field for too long), meaning they need to attack recklessly and that is where WoD come in.\r\n If they don't want to attack you just clean them with either 3 of a kind or nominclature, and go for game on open field.\r\n\r\nThe deck has a really strong matchup vs. GB, any version of burn, ReZ and also Ninjas as long as you don't get OTKed turn 2, which happened once in all my games.\r\n\r\nIt does struggle vs CA especially mindscan, since they play arround WoD. Hazy it depends if they can get BR until turn 4-5."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/control-decks/raa-by-timo-phenom/"}
