It allowed me to grab resources when I was low. This deck does well against CA REZD and Ninjas. Hazy was a difficult mu. Mind scan combos well with BigCD because then I know wether or not I can attack with my glads and still play BigCD in the same turn. The major weakness of this deck is not drawing a monster in your first 2-3 turns; Happened far less often than expected.\r\nI also believe you could probably sub out half shuts for Impenetrable Attack if you donâ€™t have them but HS is better"}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/gladiators/glad-beasts-by-smitheyyy/"}
