I'm honestly not that good  of a player and it was the first time I was playing this deck. First 5 days of the month Legend was full of Ninjas and I couldn't do anything against them when they had BDN + 2 M, 2 S/T in their hand, so I was frustrated and stopped playing for one day. When I came back to the ladder (the 7th) I won all my games to KoG, only facing a Ninja player once (he misplayed a lot)."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/gladiators/gladiator-beasts-by-nuchala/"}
