I love this deck so much. Chalice came in (un)surprisingly clutch in alot of matchups. I thought I'd miss Half Shut more than I did, but the ability to shut down key effects was just amazing. I went back and forth between 2 Cosmic Cyclones (cutting a Floodgate for it) but the prevelance of Cyber Angels required me to forgo the second one; If I expected a heavier Ninja meta I'd probably play around with it, as it's your best shot at beating them"}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/gladiators/balance-gladiators-by-numberonewaifuismercy-grand/"}
