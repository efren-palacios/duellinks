Tested a lot of different variations; liked this one the best due to the proliferation of Cyber Angels. Destiny Draw felt too clunky with the existence of a viable Aroma Strategy build, and Caninetaur can't consistently get Tiger in the grave against CA. Ninjas are tricky, but those guys misplay a lot (hoping to rectify that with the new Hazy guide, which will also show people how to play against Hazy). Glads are very easy with 3x SE and 3x Floodgate. Very fun deck overall, although the mirror match is horrible."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/hazy-flame/fluffy-and-the-riddle-by-superforms/"}
