Electro is MVP even in the 3SD build for two reasons. It locks down WOD, a huge hazy threat, and also because he becomes your opponents top priority to get rid of, only for you to bring him back next turn. Also there’s synergy with electro and perryton. \r\nOther decks I used to get 4 in a row at leg 3 were: Hazy Beat down, temple burn, cyber mind scan, cyber restart. T’was rough friends!"}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/hazy-flame/new-hazy-3-star-by-alexxwithtwoxs/"}
