Not amazing,but not bad for rez.  Works reallly well vs ninja as you can use chalice like a Mw and metalmorph on rez(>2800 attack). Chalice can be used to negate sonic bird or idaten to shut down ca combo when u dont open with a monster. Otherwise you can use chalice to defend against dakni or to go over it. Storms are neeesed to deal with heavy backrow decks. Very high win rate vs both ca and ninja in the ladder.(edited)"}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/red-eyes-zombies/red-eyes-zombies-by-drbluepepper/"}
