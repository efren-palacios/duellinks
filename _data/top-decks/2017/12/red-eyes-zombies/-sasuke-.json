Storms and Chalice also helped when playing decks that were mere counters such as burn, GB and AG. Just as any control deck AG and GB were nothing without back rows to match REZ high attack power. Chalice, when drew, also helped a lot (went back and forth from 2 chalice 1 storm to 2 storm 1 chalice, but ended up staying with double storm because I played against Ninjas more often). Chaos Hunter won many/most games vs CA and Ninjas, which were most of my games from Legend 2 - KOG. You could also try 1 Samurai Skull 1 Wyvern but in my opinion Wyvern is just too slow against Ninjas and CA. The 22 card build helped with my drawing. Rarely bricked."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/red-eyes-zombies/kog-deck-by-sasuke/"}
