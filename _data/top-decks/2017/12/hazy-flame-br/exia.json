I wasn't sure of what to use, last time I did PvP was when REZD/Handless were tier 1, and CA's + Ninjas didn't exist. Checked Dkayed's YT channel, saw his most recent hazy deck, and climbed from rookkie 1 to KoG with it in 87 duels. 77 wins, 10 losses."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/hazy-flame-br/3sd-hazy-by-exia/"}
