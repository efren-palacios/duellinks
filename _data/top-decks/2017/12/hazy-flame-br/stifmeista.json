Also really high win ratio against cyber angels and ninjas as they didn't seem to draw greatly many times, yet this deck gave me very consistent starting hands almost every time.\r\n\r\nAlso semi-free to play friendly since i don't have another soul exchange. Hazy glory isn't just a replacement for it. Sometimes the monster draw effect can be clutch."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/hazy-flame-br/sphinx-by-stifmeista/"}
