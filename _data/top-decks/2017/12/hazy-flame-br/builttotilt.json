Shien lets you beat over big monsters without Beast Rising and can be used as a decent turn 1 stun option while also being a level 7 fire. Sphere Kuriboh adds defensive utility without messing up the monster count. E-Con is kinda mandatory currently. Manticore lets us go +3 turn 1 with Cattle Drive/Peryton plays and also plays around Super Rush. Flame Tiger over Soul Exchange for general utility in recovery plays and being able to bait out Floodgate."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/hazy-flame-br/purple-hazy-by-builttotilt/"}
