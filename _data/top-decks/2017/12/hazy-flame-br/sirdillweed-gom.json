Played over 120 Matches with this and its super fun and consistent against all current meta decks. I lost 5 KoG promo matches and tilted back to L1 3 times, but most of that was self inflicted and cant be blamed on the deck.\r\nMy toughest match ups were Ninjas (obviously), and 3SD Hazy.\r\nIn the mirror, how the match plays out is very coin flip oriented. The only thing that would save me against 3SD Hazy was floodgating AFTER Peryton activated its effect, so you could get both mosters locked down.\r\nGladiators and Burn (even the new burn) were both auto wins\r\nSould Exchange, then Econ tribute their monster, take their other, then tribute for Hazy was a game winning play everytime."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/hazy-flame-br/hazy-flame-by-sirdillweed-gom/"}
