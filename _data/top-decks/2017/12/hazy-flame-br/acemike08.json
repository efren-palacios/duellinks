It proved useful during longer matches when I would brick and be able to come back and win. After learning the intricacies of this deck it really deserves it's tier 2 spot. Played with a ton of decks to varying results before settling on this after watching the MCS. This deck is a ton of fun and a great way to get around the cancer that is burn. 10/10 would climb again."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/hazy-flame-br/hazy-by-acemike08/"}
