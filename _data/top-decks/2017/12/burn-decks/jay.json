But kept facing CA 5 times in a row, at which point, I knew I had to switch to Destiny Draw Burn.\r\nTwo key components in this deck was rabbits and Xing Zhen Hu. This is especially important when facing a mirror match or Weevil burn deck because rabbits return to your hand even if your opponents massivemorph them, meaning they can't summon lava golem. Also, Xing Zhen Hu practically makes their backrow useless."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/burn-decks/cyber-angel-by-jay/"}
