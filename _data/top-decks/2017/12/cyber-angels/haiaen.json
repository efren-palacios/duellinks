I tried Xing, Gyokkou, and a few other tech but none came close. I don't understand why its taken CA so long to run AMA! \r\nJust a small side note: The 5 ritual spells help ALOT - 4 just isnt enough considering the speed you burn through spells even if youre able to get Idaten off multiple times!\r\n\r\nBtw - Credit to whoever thought of AMA first! I know I saw it somewhere here!"}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/cyber-angels/ama-cybers-by-haiaen/"}
