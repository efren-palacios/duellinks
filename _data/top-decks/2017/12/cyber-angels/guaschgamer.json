Saffira is great too. I found her very useful when I see my opponent struggling with resources, I get her out and have them discard. at the point, they would scoop. I ran no birds cause I personally found it cloggy on the field and eats up your normal summon when you could've used it for your senju or cyber petit."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/cyber-angels/cyber-angels-by-guaschgamer/"}
