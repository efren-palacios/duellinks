Took a while because I only had 2 Dakini's and have dropped around 3k blue keys with no luck still. Used Mind Scan until Legend 1. Got frustrated at bricking and wanted more consistency, so switched to restart. The deck is nothing new really, still proud of my first KoG regardless. Been playing for 28 days as of today"}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/cyber-angels/ca-by-rezo/"}
