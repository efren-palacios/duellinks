I was going second as a cyber angel deck and had the Turn 2 OTK, but I surrendered to give him KoG. Afterwards I looked at his deck and this is what he was running.  I think I only lost twice from Legend 1 to KoG using this deck.  The MVP was the anti-magic arrows.  Over half of my wins came after playing AMA since nobody is playing around it."}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/cyber-angels/cyber2-by-jjskuld/"}
