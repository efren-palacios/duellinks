IMO, I'll rate restart>balance>mindscan for this particular deck list. Because brick is real in mind scan. As for balance, I would suggest running 3 senjus + 2 petit. \r\nGyokkou comes in handy against most of the current meta decks *be sure to activate it before summoning.\r\nXing zhen hu helps alot in locking down tight back row too.\r\nThis is a deck where you'll have a high % in OTK-ing early game.\r\nSpecial thanks to Negative1 - CA Expert  for skill and techs suggestions^^ thank you senpai"}],"url":"/top-decks/december-2017/cyber-angels/cybertron-restart-by-dto/"}
