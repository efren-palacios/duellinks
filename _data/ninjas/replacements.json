    "reason": "Senior Silver Ninja is a great option to substitute any missing sasukes. Its ability to swarm the field with other ninja cards after being flip summoned is a great way to open-up your plays. Best utilized when you duplication a level 6 or 7 ninja at the end of an opponent’s turn. You can re-summon the card that you used to duplication out Senior Silver Ninja. Downside of this card is you need to protect the monster it summons, because they will be summoned in face-down defense mode. Ninja’s defense is not high and being face-down means you cannot transformation those summoned ninjas. Also, it requires your opponent to attack into Silver Senior Ninja in other to really speed up the summoning process. I originally had 3 of these cards in here, but opt-ed to take out all of them in favor of a 3rd BDN and 2 Sasukes. I’ve seen some explosive plays off Senior Silver Ninja though, so it is not a BAD replacement. You need to protect it and the monsters it summons."

    "reason": "You can transformation into from your RDN or BDN. Can be helpfully in situation where your transformation is being targeted and will be destroyed regardless. So rather than let it be destroyed for nothing, you can get a phoenix out for the next turn. However, it is level 8 and drawing into it can be a dead draw, because it cannot be used for BDN fuel OR quickly summoned."
