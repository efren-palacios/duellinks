    "about": "Hi, I'm Kieran from the UK. I originally played the TCG at a semi-competitive level between 2006 and 2011 at my local shop Mad for Miniatures. It was a good community with weekly tournaments with between 35-60 players. Now a third year Law student, I've been playing Duel Links for neatly a year. My past KoG decks have included: Venus Lotus, Six Samurai and most recently Aliens. I'm passionate about Duel links and very active Discord member. If anyone ever has any questions feel free to PM me.",
