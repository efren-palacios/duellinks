    "about": "I've been playing Duel Links since February of 2017. I never imagined I would be playing the game for this long to be honest. The fast paced dueling format, the competitive scene from DLM community and friends I've made along the way have kept me here. My favorite archetypes released in Duel Links so far have been Ninjas and Gladiator Beasts. I'm 26 years old, currently living in North Carolina. Huge fan of anime and combat sports. I'm pretty laid back so if you ever want to share ideas, need help testing or anything Duel Links related hit me up on the Discord.",
