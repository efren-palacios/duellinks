    "about": "Im the Alien expert of the Duel Links Meta Discord. That means a lot to me because this is my favorite archetype in Yugioh. Ive been waiting for them since I picked up Duel Links back in February 2017 by watching a Shady Penguinn video. Im 19 years old from New york. I played a fair bit of Yugioh when I was in middle school but didnt play any after until Duel Links. The Alien archetype interests me because ever since I was a kid, I have been intrigued by them in real life. Im planning to to be an astronomer. All in all im a Yugioh nerd. I'll be happy to give any advice on Duel Links or anything in general. Thanks for reading!",
