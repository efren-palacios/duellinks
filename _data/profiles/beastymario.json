    "about": "I’m a 26 year old college grad living in Southern California with a passion in Yu-Gi-Oh. I first started playing Yu-gi-oh on its release of the TCG. As a kid, I would remember waiting all week for Saturday morning so that I could watch the newest episodes. I continued to play the TCG for a couple of years, even winning a few locals along the way, until suddenly I lost the passion and stopped playing. When Duel Links was released, it brought back many childhood memories and my passion for the game was reborn. Along the way was when I discovered Duel Links Meta; teaching me many more things about the competitive aspect of Duel Links. From there I joined the community, of what now is the Duel Links Meta Discord, and making many friends along the way. This community is like one big family. We help one another and bring out the competitiveness within us, in the casual and/or tournament setting. If you’re ever in need of any help, whether it’s - testing, random questions (Duel Links related or not) or wanting to have a chill conversation, I’m your guy. Giving back to the community has always been a big philosophy of mine so I try to do so whenever I can.",
