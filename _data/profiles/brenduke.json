    "about": "I have played Duel Links since its European release in January 2017 and I got my first King of Games in February using a Harpy Lady deck. After my first KoG I lost interest in the game but I returned when Gladiator Beasts were announced since that was my favourite deck in the Trading Card Game which I played competitively up to late 2010 only quitting to start university. Discovering the competitive Duel Links scene has allowed me to fall back in love with a game which I had missed for seven years. I consider myself to be a creative player and have created a handful of decks myself and others have used to hit King of Games with. I have also written in-depth guides for the Gladiator Beast and Destiny Hero Archetypes. In real life my name is Brendan, I am 26 years old and live in the north of England. When I am not tagging out Gladiators I am usually writing up my PhD thesis on the fascinating subject of sensory marketing. I am passionate and knowledgeable about Duel Links and I am always happy to help out players on the Discord, just send me a ping. I will also use this space to say that I am looking for a team as player or coach for team wars season three.",
