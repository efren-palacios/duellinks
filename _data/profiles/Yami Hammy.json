    "about": "I'm from the UK, studying BSc Mathematics at university. Duel Links reignited my passion for Yu-Gi-Oh, bringing back all the nostalgia and spurred me to join the best Duel Links community - Duel Links Meta! I haven't competed in any community tournaments due to the constrictions on my time by university and website stuff but I hope to in future. I’ve rewatched all episodes of Duel Monsters (and YGOTAS!), GX and I’m currently watching 5D’s. If you need help with anything or have questions feel free to message or ping me in the Discord 😄",
    "accomplishments": "I've been playing Duel Links consistently since the European release in January 2017 - 476 consecutive days! ,I joined as a 'Content Creator' on the website team and I'm now a Content Manager/Graphic Artist - started from the bottom now we here! ,I've reached King of Games over ten times and I finally got my 10x icon in the April season! I still remember getting KoG for the first time with Mako Levia-Dragon - Daedalus&#44; when no one knew what the toggle was&#44; having even one Enemy Controller was rare and the meta was much simpler! :D, I love swimming&#44; I used to be a qualified lifeguard.,Self-proclaimed 'Mini-Dev'!",
