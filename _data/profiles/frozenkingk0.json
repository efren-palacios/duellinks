    "about": "I have been playing Duel Links since the November Steam release and have achieved King of Games every season since then. I have won multiple local TCG tournaments and have participated in regional and national tournaments for the TCG between 2007 - 2012. I have created a Six Samurai guide as they are my passion and loved playing them back in the TCG achieving lots of success in tournaments. I am patiently waiting for Synchro's to make their way into Duel Links so I can apply my knowledge from the TCG era to Duel Links success.",
