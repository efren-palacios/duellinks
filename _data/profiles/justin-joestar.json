    "about": "I'm from Switzerland and still going to school. I found out about Duel Links through one of those cringy Advertisements on YouTube. As a fan of the original Yu-Gi-Oh! Series, I was hoping to be able to play as Noah Kaiba one day... I usually don't play in duel links tournaments, as I'm moderating them. If I do play, I usually only play Memes, like Toons. Toons are a great archetype! I hope to see more, non-gamebreaking support for them in the future. My favorite Anime is Nanatsu no Taizai. The most awesome characters are Gloxinia and King (and not Ban! - fight me Gia!). People find me outside of the Discord together with friends, or in skateparks.",
